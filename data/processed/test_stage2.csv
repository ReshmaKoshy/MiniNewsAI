"Negative space, in art, is defined as the area that surrounds the subject of an image. Think the black blanket of night cast against the jagged edges of a skyscraper, or the misty blue ocean punctuated by a lone figure in the middle. Negative space allows our eyes to focus on the subject, no matter how subtle it may be. It also allows us to revel in the beauty of simplicity, the artistic equivalent of staring at a cloudless sky.

"Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva appeared in an Instagram video this month. Three days later, she tested positive for a banned substance at the Pyeongchang Winter Games. The video showing Sergeeva wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, “I don’t do doping. I am ZASPORT,” has since been deleted from Instagram. The clip was reportedly posted to Instagram on Feb. 15 by Russia-based videographer Roman Bibishev. Sergeeva denied taking the drug that triggered the positive result. She finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event in Pyeonchang. The International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Games over its state-backed doping program. The IOC said it considered lifting the suspension for Sunday’s closing ceremony so OAR athletes could march under the Russian flag. In the end, the committee decided to keep the ban in place because of the two failed drug tests. It is the second Russian athlete to fail a doping test at thePyeongChang Games. Alexander Krushelnitsky, an Olympic curler, was forced to return his bronze medal last week after testing positive for meldonium, a potential performance-enhancing drug.

By versing themselves in the language of Disney, Owen’s parents were able to reacquaint themselves with his inner life, and eventually help him regain his speech. The book has since served as the jumping-off point for a film directed by Academy Award winner Roger Ross Williams, whose documentary “Life, Animated” is up for an Oscar this year. The movie opens at a crossroads: Owen, a young adult, is preparing to live independently. He tells his own story to Williams, explaining his interest in Disney heroes, villains and plots. He also shares his own creative endeavor, a story he wrote called “The Land of Lost Sidekicks,” a world filled with roaming characters who’ve been left behind by their heroic counterparts. In Owen's story, which Williams says is parallel to Owen's life, the sidekicks have to find their inner heroes. “We all need story to survive, but this is about the power of story to transform one life in such a profound way.” Williams emphasized that the message of his film, ultimately, was about the enduring power of storytelling.

"Ecuador's firebrand leftist President Rafael Correa lambasted US oil giant Chevron as an enemy for allegedly besmirching his country. Last year an Ecuadoran court ordered Chevron to pay $19 billion dollars for polluting the rain forest. Correa says the company has spent $400 million and hired an army of hundreds of lawyers to discredit the government and get the ruling overturned on appeal in the country's highest court. Chevron has never worked directly in Ecuador but inherited the pollution lawsuit when it acquired Texaco in 2001. Chevron operated in Ecuador from 1964 to 1990 and after leaving it was sued by indigenous groups in pollution-related legal proceedings that have dragged on for nearly 20 years. The plan to have rich countries pay $3.6 billion into a trust fund for Ecuador in exchange for its not drilling in the Amazon was abandoned this week because so little money had been contributed, Correa said. The case is still alive and Correa is strong on protecting the environment and six years ago came up with a novel plan: have rich nations pay $2 billion into the trust fund in return for Ecuador not drilling for oil in the rainforest. But this week Correa finally abandoned the plan because so much money had not been contributed. It is not clear if Chevron will pay the $2.2 billion in back taxes as promised. The company has not commented on the report. The report is based on interviews with more than 100 people who worked for Chevron in Ecuador over the course of several years.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

The results also show that the amount of sulfate injected into the. stratosphere by these eruption events may have been around half that previously estimated, suggesting. that summer temperatures may be highly sensitive to high latitude. volcanic eruption. The sensitivity of temperature to high-latitude eruptions highlights the role of climate feedbacks, such as sea ice extent and ocean heat content, in amplifying changes in global climate. ""High latitudes feel these amplified climate changes particularly strongly, which is concerning given how rapidly these regions are changing today,"" said Dr. Burke. The paper is titled ""High sensitivity ofsummer temperaturesto stratospheric sulfur loading from volcanoes in the Northern Hemisphere"" and published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

"The company that owns the tank that leaked thousands of gallons of hazardous chemicals should have known that there was the potential for an incident. Freedom Industries told state officials nearly a year ago that it was keeping thousands of pounds of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol in the company's storage facility. The disclosure was included in paperwork that Freedom Industries had filed under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Despite the storage facility's proximity to the water supply, it does not appear that the company, state or local officials had any emergency response plan in place. If you're a West Virginian whose water supply has been affected, we want to hear from you. What impact has the chemical spill had on you? How are you coping without using tap water? How well do you feel the situation has been handled? Email us here with your stories, photographs, or anything else you want to share. Please include your name, and a phone number if you're willing to speak with a reporter. The state Department of Environmental Protection had not inspected the Freedom Industries site in more than 20 years.

Construction is underway at Stanford University to build an even brighter laser that will work in parallel with the existing LCLS. The $1 billion project is described in a stunning new video that was posted to YouTube on Monday. It will include a superconducting accelerator to propel electrons through a series of cavities, resulting in an almost continuous laser beam with pulses that are 10,000 times brighter, on average, than those of the existing laser. The new laser is scheduled to begin operations in the early 2020s, while the existing one will continue to operate for the next few years. a six-month recess scheduled in 2017 for construction, and a yearlong shutdown extending from 2018 into 2019, is scheduled for the project's completion in 2019. In the meantime, the existing Laser will continue operating, except for a year-long recess scheduled for 2017 and 2018, according to the lab's website. The laser can generate beams of extremely bright X-rays by using the energy of electrons accelerated to nearly the speed of light. It is capable of creating up to 1 millionX-ray flashes per second. It uses a copper accelerator that operates at room temperature and allows for the generation of 120 X-Ray pulses per second, meanwhile, LclS uses a room temperature accelerator that allows for an average of 120 pulses a second.

"India's wheat planting is expected to remain stagnant despite a rally in prices to near record highs. Lower soil moisture prompts farmers in some areas to switch to less water-intensive crops. Limited planting area, along with the threat of higher-than-normal first-quarter temperatures curbing yields, could compel the world's second-biggest wheat producer to maintain its export ban or even force it to resort to imports. Farmers in the country had planted wheat on 8.6 million hectares as of Nov. 17, down nearly 5.5% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare. In neighbouring Maharashtra state, farmer Avinash Phalke earlier this month planted sorghum on three acres instead of wheat.

Sachs and Starr had already developed a ritual of reenacting classic films with his grandmother Maxine, who has Alzheimer’s. They invited those in the class to vote on which one they’d like to appear in, and the class selected “annie Hall” The film follows the romance between Alvy Singer, an overanxious comedian, and Annie Hall, a breezy and capricious nightclub singer. It tells a story in a nonlinear fashion. It comes down to the question of: What do we remember and why do we remembers it? It’S a beautiful comparison to what some of our students might be experiencing. Many of the actors are dealing, in various ways, with the reality of their minds changing and memories fading. The actors don’t have cell phones, so they have to call them at 7 in the morning or 8 at night.

"Fossil fuels make up about 80% of the North American energy mix and this will drop sharply to about 40% by 2050. Coal demand in North America (including Canada) peaked in 2000. Any policies that extend the life of fossil fuels as a domestic power source will only add to household energy bills. Moving to a more electrified and less carbon intensive energy system will impact employment patterns, particularly in those states which have a history of fossil fuel extraction. For households, it is important those with a low income are not left behind. The upfront costs of devices such as heat pumps, which are at the heart of the residential energy transition, can dissuade low-income households from investing in these. These households are then at risk of missing out on the reduction in their energy bill in the long run, which is a form of the phenomenon dubbed ‘the poverty tax’ in popular parlance. We forecast that 12 trillion dollars will be spent on renewables and the grid between now and 2050.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

A month into our time together, I told Dottie I wasn't writing frequently enough, that I felt tense and was overthinking when I went to write. Her response was to send me a text message every night for the entire month of October, 2013. Every night I turned somersaults, guzzled a rainbow of different fruit juices, plunged into scalding baths--all the while jotting down phrases on a big yellow legal pad. The end of every ritual culminated in a poem. As time passed, a sense of the spiritual and sacred suffused my apartment and all of its contents. It had all become part of my poetry--the thing that mattered most to me in the world. The night after I completed the Ninth Universe, I wrote a Tenth. More Universes followed and eventually, with her earlier prompts, they formed the bedrock of my first chapbook, AEONS, winner of the 2014 Poetry Society of America Chapbook competition. It's a rare thing for a book of poems to be born in a single classroom. I wanted her to discuss her educational philosophy, which is idiosyncratic in the extreme.

"Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has been slammed as racist and xenophobic. Wildlife scientists say the wall could trigger major environmental problems, damaging delicate ecosystems. The ability to roam freely is critically important because it helps animals find food and water as well as mates. A wall could reduce the number of animals along the border and make them less genetically diverse and more vulnerable to disease and drought, they say. It could affect 111 endangered species and 108 migratory bird species, some of which are endangered, the Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated. The wall would cost untold billions to build, and it's not clear if the political fallout would be enough to persuade Trump to drop his plan, or if it could harm our national symbol, too. The Wall, by the way, is not currently being funded by the federal government, according to a report by the Center for American Progress, a think tank that focuses on free-market capitalism and free-enterprise economics. It's unclear whether the wall will ever be built, but it's a good idea to keep an eye on the future of the country, the group said in a report last month. It also said that the wall would have a negative impact on the economy, which is already suffering from low unemployment and stagnant wages.

But what will happen under more advanced climatechange? How will vegetation respond to projected changes in atmospheric CO2, temperatures, and rainfall? Our study shows plants might take up more CO2than previously thought. We found climate modeling that best accounted for the processes that sustain plant life consistently predicted the strongest CO2uptake.

"Study: People with certain personality traits are more likely to develop a social media addiction. neuroticism, conscientiousness and agreeableness were related to addiction. Two other personality traits, extraversion and openness to experience, weren’t linked with addiction. More research is needed to confirm the findings, but the findings could have implications for those who treat tech addictions, the researchers said.. The study was conducted by Binghamton University in New York state and was published in the journal Systems Science. It was presented in January at the 51st Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science, which was held in Hawaii. It’s important to note that because the study involved a few hundred college students at a single university, the findings are not yet conclusive, according to the researchers. The researchers said they hope the findings will encourage people to look at the “whole picture” of how personality traits affect tech addiction, “rather than just focusing on one personality trait” at a time. They added that users with higher levels of IT addictions may not be considered as one homogeneous group of users, as different personality traits can play different roles in users’ dispositions toward IT addiction,” the researchers wrote in their paper. The research was conducted on 300 college students, who were asked to assess their personality and gauge their level of addiction to the social media site each individual used most frequently.

"Harvey, the most intense rainfall event in U.S. history, stalled over southeast Texas and dropped more than three feet of rain over thousands of square miles in a matter of days. Researchers showed that in the wake of the storm, a form of evolution called spatial sorting exerted a greater influence on the evolution of J. haematoloma, commonly known as the red-shouldered soapberry bug. With natural selection, change plays out over decades or even millennia as traits become more common or less common depending on which individuals survive and reproduce. With spatial sorting, change occurs when species move into new territory, and traits are more common based on where individuals are at the leading edge of range expansion, the researchers say.""This is an understudied and underappreciated form of evolutionary change that has emerged from the invasive species literature,"" said Rice University evolutionary biologist Scott Egan.

"Scientists have uncovered that violent star collisions, known as kilonovae, have the potential to pose a catastrophic threat to our planet due to the lethal release of radiation. The collision of neutron stars, each containing a mass equivalent to approximately one billion tons within a mere teaspoon, results in a particle explosion capable of annihilating our planet's ozone layer. If a neutron star merger were to occur within around 36 light-years of Earth, the resulting radiation could cause an extinction-level event. The specific distance of safety and component that is most dangerous is uncertain as many of the effects depend on properties like viewing angle to the event, the energy of the blast, the mass of material ejected, and more,” Haille Perkins, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said.

""We intuitively believe that we are directly aware of things at any moment in time,"" Dr. Frank Scharnowski says.

"George Preti, an organic chemist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, says the amount of odor you produce is largely based on your genetics. Different regions of the body produce their own strange molecular secretions and play host to different sorts of microbes. The reason certain odors are worse than others is because microbes become ecologically adapted to the environments that they are in. Despite popular belief, Preti says, eating spicy food, onions, curry, or garlic is not going to make your body produce more potentially smelly proteins. But certain foods can still make you smell worse: if pungent foods contain fat-soluble compounds that dissolve in your body fat, they’ll often get released in your sweat. So you won’t make more odor proteins, but you may add a note of garlic to your signature perfume. But your big takeaway should be this: you’re almost certainly less smelly than you think you are. “I’ve smelled so many people who come into the lab saying that they have the worst body odor in the world,” says Preti. ‘That would be an extremely unusual case.’ Humans tune out the smells we smell all the time. So if you do produce the most smelly body odor, you probably don�’s don�t really have your worst odor. And your nose has a front row seat to producing the odor, because they are not producing it.”",SAFE,SCIENCE

"Gift exchanges are a big part of American Christmas culture, often with a variety of creative spins on the tradition. Depending on where you grew up, you may call this gift exchange game Yankee Swap, White Elephant or Dirty Santa. Versions of this tradition were around as early as 1901, when mentions of “swap parties” appeared in American publications. According to popular legend, the term “white elephant” is related to an old practice from kings of Siam (today, Thailand). If the king was dissatisfied with one of his subjects, he would gift them a rare albino elephant. In Thai and Buddhist cultures, white elephants are not snow-colored or pinkish, but rather more ruddy-colored, and have a sacred quality. This story of the white elephant appears to be more of a myth, though the definition of � “ white elephant’s” seems to be a more accurate one.‘Yankee Swap’ is more popular in New England, though plenty of people in other parts of the country use it to describe this kind of gift exchange. The folks at Dunder Mifflin in Scranton, Pennsylvania, turned their Secret Santa gift exchange into Yankee Swap in an iconic episode of ‘The Office.’ The origin of the name seems to date back to the 19th century, when “Yankees” allegedly had a reputation as constant traders looking to make a swap. If you believe the Civil War origin story, you might be of the mindset that Yankee Swap gifts are supposed to be “useful” or of higher quality than the ones in White Elephant.",SAFE,ARTS & CULTURE

"Wendy Suzuki, 51, is a neuroscientist at New York University. Her research focuses on understanding the effects of exercise on the brain. Aerobic exercise can boost the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is one of the primary targets of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Building up the hippocampus over a lifetime could potentially delay effects of diseases. Another brain area heavily affected by aerobic exercise is the prefrontal cortex. This is an area in charge of high-level cognition, executive functions, decision-making and attention. Walking, aerobic exercise and high-intensity interval training can improve your mood. But unlike memory, improvements with attention are more acute and come faster. Jogging, biking and running are all good options for getting a boost in the prefrontal Cortex. The best evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis is continuous aerobic exercise. “You have to get your heart rate up. A good 45-minute workout is the best option if you want to boost your memory,” Suzuki said. She said. ‘The thing that was really exciting and appealing is that this was the kind of research that could immediately be applied to helping people live their life better,’ she said, “but once I made the decision I knew it was the right one.” She also thought it was a particularly good decision because the results of her work could quickly lead to tangible benefits.

Hartman understands pastiche and mosaic and these paintings could be redone more abstractedly. She is aware of humankind's temporary state in transit, always in flux.

"A new report says the New England Patriots are grappling with power struggles. Tom Brady is said to be deeply involved with Alex Guerrero, a personal health trainer. That relationship has eroded the power of head coach Bill Belichick, the report says. The Patriots denied the reports in a statement Friday, dismissing them as ""unsubstantiated, highly exaggerated or flat out inaccurate” The report says Belichick is more isolated and frustrated than ever, which could lead him to seek greener pastures in the offseason. The report also says the Patriots' offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator will likely leave the team during the offseason this year and become head coaches for other teams. Click here to read the full report at ESPN.com. The New York Times, Boston Magazine and Boston.com all published stories on the subject in recent months. The Times called Guerrero Brady’s “spiritual guide, counselor, pal, nutrition adviser, trainer, massage therapist and family member.” Boston Magazine has a slightly different take, portraying him as a modern-day snake oil salesman who’d had repeated troubles with regulators until he found the ultimate sucker in Tom Brady. The Federal Trade Commission came after Guerrero in 2004 for a supplement he peddled on a late-night infomercial, claiming it cured 96 percent of a group of 200 terminally ill cancer patients.

Only because one of the quick thinking actors realized there were people in the hallway that didn't belong and yelled ""cut"" did that scene not end in tragedy.

"The Large Hadron Collider, a 17-mile-long particle accelerator on the Swiss-French border, was shut down after a weasel gnawed through a transformer. The charred remains of the small beast were reportedly found by engineers investigating the situation. It is unclear whether the animals are trying to stop humanity from unlocking the secrets of the universe. The European Organization for Nuclear Research suggests the animal may have been a marten, according to an official report on the incident. The animal died, the EONR says, and plans to restart the collider were delayed several days because of the incident and several other small factors, the Associated Press reports. The E ONR says it is investigating the incident, but no further action has been taken against the weasel or marten. The LHC is the world's most powerful particle collider and is located on the French-Swiss border. The Collider is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, and will be able to conduct research on the universe's origins and the formation of atoms and molecules for the first time since the universe was created in 380,000 years ago. The particle accelerator is the largest of its kind in the world, with a capacity of more than 1.5 million colliders. It has been used to study the origin of light and dark matter, among other things, as well as to make new drugs and treatments for cancer, heart disease, and other conditions that affect the nervous system and the immune system.",SENSITIVE,SCIENCE
"European researchers found that each of us has an ""individual motor signature"" The extent to which your movements are similar to another person’s can determine how easily you can coordinate with that person. By comparing the two individuals' movement signatures, the researchers could also determine the level of comfort and rapport in the relationship. The researchers concluded that analyzing these motor signatures could one day offer a new pathway into diagnosing and treating mental illness, such as conditions involving social phobias. the study was published in the journal Interface on Wednesday, and involved a series of three experiments and about 82 participants. It turned out that the players who were better at mimicking each other's movements -- including qualities like speed and weight of movement -- also exhibited more collective behaviors. The study shows that people who move in a certain way, will also react in similar ways when they are performing joint tasks, Dr. Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova said. ""This could therefore be used in the future to help diagnose patients with certain conditions by studying how they move and react to others,"" she said in a statement. ""Essentially, our movements give an insight into our inherent personality traits,"" the study's co-author said.

Larger parrotfish are like sand factories, producing as much as 840 pounds of sand per year. For Oahu’s snorkeling hot spot, Hanauma Bay, that means hundreds of tons of fish-made sand each year.. Worms, sponges, and oysters also produce Pacific ocean sand, but no animal is as proficient as the parrot fish, a badge of honor it has held for centuries. According to the Maui Ocean Center, the native Hawaiian name for the female redlip parrot Fish translates to “loose bowels.” We can see why: The fish doesn’t have stomachs, their meals pass straight through the long intestine, exploding in a cloud of sand out the backdoor. The fish is the reason Hawaii beaches are constantly ranked the best in the world, where a significant portion of that pristine, white, beautiful sand is actually poop.

The reason behind the SE 4 being relatively lightweight is that it sports a single camera instead of the triple-lens we see on the 14. You get a 48-megapixel rear camera with a custom backplate that caters to the design change. In terms of how the iPhones differ in terms of design, there are two main features: the multi-purpose Action button and a USB-C port, both of which were recently seen on the iPhone 15. All of it is based on prototypes and conjecture, and it is always possible that some of it might change during the development phase.",SAFE,SPORTS
"In the first two weeks of November, fires destroyed nearly 770,000 hectares (1.9 million acres) of the world's largest tropical wetlands.

The state of Mato Grosso do Sul launched on Nov. 14 a joint task force, mobilizing the state’s entire fleet of aircraft to help firefighters, either dropping water on fires or flying out firefighters to the region”s most remote locations.

"Jeff Koons' new series of paintings, ""Gazing Ball,"" were painted by artists he knows or has trained. Louis Nizer: Many of the artists who worked on the paintings are very fine artists in their own right. Koons is truly an ""Artist as CEO"" who, if anything, seems to enjoy showing off the fact that skill is something he can afford, says Nizer. Nizer says maybe, just maybe, it's a good thing that skilled representation by friends of Steven Assael made its way into Gagosian gallery, whose names will be the ones who get credit for the work, he says. ""I'm basically the idea person,"" Jeff Koons once told an interviewer, ""I don't have the necessary abilities, so I go to the top people"" and he does create employment for artists, Nizer writes. ""It's like saying that some top bankers should go to jail for their roles in the 2007-8 subprime mortgage crisis: it's old news and hardly anyone is interested, especially in New York,"" Nizer adds.

The online gallery is accompanied by a quote from filmmaker Jordan Peele. “Art is the one tool we have against the true horrors of the world,” he said. ‘Get Out’ is an inclusive experience that inspires people to just talk,’ Peele said. The film recently crossed the $100 million mark at the box office. It's about a white woman who brings her black boyfriend to meet her family for the first time. The movie was written and directed by Peele and stars Lakeith Stanfield, Daniel Kaluuya and Keegan-Michael-Beadle. It was released in theaters on March 26. It has already grossed more than $93 million worldwide. It is the second-highest-grossing film of the year so far, behind only “La La Land” (which made $103 million in the U.S. in 2013). The film is based on the novel by Stephen King and is directed by Jordan Peeve, who is also the writer and director of “Carrie” and “Get Out.” It is about a black woman and her white boyfriend who meet in the suburbs for the very first time, and what happens when they find out they’re both from different sides of the same racial divide.

"Researchers from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) and Loyola University have discovered that personality does not seem to have much influence when it comes to choosing social friendships at school. This work is important because it challenges the common belief that friendships are based on similarity—that is, homophily. This understanding may have important implications for how we understand and build our friendships, especially in societies where cultural and thought homogeneity may be highly valued. In short, this research can help us build healthier and more productive relationships in our personal and professional lives, say the study's authors. The research may also have implications for the creation of workplace policies and practices. For example, if employers understand that differences among workers can be beneficial for creativity andjob performance, they could encourage diversity in their teams and work environments, they say.

""We thought we were dealing with experts,"" Pickles said on Sunday. ""It was a mistake, there's no doubt about that, and we perhaps have relied too much on the Environment Agency's advice,"" he told the BBC, saying the government now realised rivers should have been dredged to help prevent flooding, he said. The leader of Britain's anti-European Union party UKIP, Nigel Farage, has called for some of the overseas aid budget to be diverted to help tackle the flooding. ""Too little, too late,"" said Farage, speaking to the BBC during a visit to the region on Sunday, he described the government’s response as ""too little,too late""",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

"Ellen Weider has been engaged with the print medium for over thirty years. Her solo exhibit at the Manhattan Graphics Center in Manhattan showcases twenty-five black and white prints. Drypoint is a type of intaglio process, frequently used in combination with etching and acquatint. The majority of Weider's plates are circular. This serves to stand either in contrast to rectangular and angular constructs, or as a repetitive iteration of spherical elements within. Top motifs for Weider embrace the use of organic forms that speak to the mysteries of nature, and an ongoing vocabulary of geometric, architectural, and personal iconography. In Wish List, Weider places totemic hieroglyphics onto the façade of a chest of drawers. A series of scratchings evocative of the female body inhabit the center panel. The nervous energy and quirky, tactile lines of Drypoint reference the ironic humor of a New Yorker cartoon. Contained within the impression, here is a chair without a sitter and ordinariness of every day life. A companion piece, Balance, offers the viewer another piece of furniture -- a table without a leg -- a leg hovers between a metaphysical interpretation and the question of ""When is a table just a table?""

"Researchers in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have hit a breakthrough in their quest to develop pigs whose organs and other tissues can be transplanted into humans. The team, led by a biotechnology company called eGenesis, announced Thursday that it has successfully used a powerful gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to modify the DNA in pig cells. It's a huge step, as those viruses (more specifically known as porcine endogenous retroviruses, or PERVs) pose a not-yet-fully-understood but potentially significant health threat to humans. Next, the company needs to make sure it can consistently replicate virus-free pigs, which it’s already well on its way to doing. After that, it will need to test how the human immune system responds to the organs and modify them so they aren’t rejected, creating what she referred to as “pig 2.0,” featuring “advanced immune compatibility.” In the United States alone, almost 117,000 people are currently awaiting a lifesaving organ transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. About 60 percent of transplant operations since 1988 have been for a kidney (which has an average wait time of five years), 22 percent a liver (wait time: 11 months), 10 percent a heart (four months), and 5 percent a lung (4 months) The company is making very real, tangible progress toward that goal, but it doesn't want to speculate on when xenotransplantation might be a common procedure.",SAFE,SCIENCE

The worst effects could be avoided if we slash or stop carbon emissions. World leaders have pledged to keep global warming below a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius. But the world isn't there yet, and global temperature records -- including the one set in February, the warmest such month on record -- continue to be broken.. The authors expanded the sea level rise estimates to the year 2500, and found that Antarctica could cause more than 50 feet of sea level Rise alone. In an interview with The Guardian, co-author Rob DeConto said global warming could force ""retreat"" from cities, rather than the ""engineering of defenses"" to avoid the worst effects of sealevel rise. But he noted that if humans are able to slash emissions, most of the Antarctic would remain frozen.

"Beitar Jerusalem says it is adding ""Trump"" to the team's name. The team says it wants to honor President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital city and moving the U.S. embassy there. The move has stirred resentment among Palestinians who hope to establish their own future capital in east Jerusalem. Beitar requires approval from the Israel Football Association, and could face legal challenges because “Donald Trump” is a registered trademark in Israel. The six-time league champion team has been penalized before because some fans have chanted anti-Arab and Muslim slogans during matches, CNN pointed out. The name change is not a done deal, according to The Jerusalem Post, and the team has not said if it will change its name to ""Beitar Trump Jerusalem"" or ""Beitel Trump Jerusalem,"" as the team previously said it would do if the name change was approved by the FA. The club's offices were once set on fire after it signed two Muslim players in 2013, and fans have been known to chant anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian slogans at matches. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning the move, but it has yet to be implemented by the United States, which is scheduled to open its embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. The embassy was scheduled to be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, sparking fierce protests, but the move was delayed until later in the week by the Obama administration.

Biofluorescence is when molecules in the skin of an organism absorb the blue-hued wavelengths of visible light in the water and re-emit them as other colors. The team noticed the sharks increase the contrast of their biofluorescent glowing pattern the deeper they travel underwater. The contrast makes them brighter, allowing the sharks to make themselves more visible to neighbors of the same species and possibly communicate with each other, the researchers said in a statement. The researchers recently also made the first observation ofBiofluorescence in marine turtles. that all of these findings are ""a big step toward a functional explanation for fluorescence in fishes,"" said John Sparks, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History’s Department of Ichthyology and a co-author of the study.

"Soft material-based actuators have gotten a lot of attention in the scientific community in recent years because of their lightweight, quiet operation, and biodegradability. Researchers from Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Italy and Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, developed a system that enables accurate force measurement in these actuators. The technique can be used to create robot muscles, changeable optics, and tactile surfaces. The study was published research in Nature Electronics. The research could lead to low-cost, high-performance solutions for assistive devices, automatic machines, and mobile robots for terrestrial, marine, and space exploration, according to the researchers.

A neurological disease known as avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) that causes brain lesions and impaired motor skills that ultimately result in death is a new danger the bald eagle species faces. The culprit seems to be blue-green algae, which becomes concentrated in the eagles' prey.

"The Guggenheim Museum has removed three controversial artworks from an upcoming exhibition. The works, all by conceptual Chinese artists, came under fire last week when activists characterized them as “instances of unmistakable cruelty against animals in the name of art” In a statement on Monday, the museum claimed that “explicit and repeated threats of violence” ultimately led to the works’ removal. “Art and China After 1989” features avant-garde pieces from 150 Chinese artists working between the end of the Cold War and 2008. Themes of globalization, utopia, oppression, authority, violence, competition and control are prevalent throughout the show, with animals often symbolizing the debased human condition many endured during this transformative period in Chinese history. The final piece on the final block is Xu Bing’s “A Case Study of Transference,” which includes a live boar and sow in front of an audience. The original piece had comprised of temporary tattoos of nonsensical text in Roman characters. The American Kennel Club also released a statement, declaring, “Depictions of animal cruelty are not art’” Another contested work, the title piece of the exhibition, is Huang Yong Ping”s 1993 “Theater of the World” The work is a wood, steel and mesh dome equipped with heating lamps that can house hundreds of insects and reptiles inside, including locusts, crickets, beetles, grasshoppers, geckos and cockroaches.",SENSITIVE,ARTS & CULTURE

"China launches its first privately developed rocket from a launchpad in northwestern China. The launch of the “Chongqing Liangjiang Star” rocket marks the first time a non-state Chinese rocket has successfully entered orbit. Chinese President Xi Jinping has made becoming a “space flight superpower’ a top priority for the Chinese government. The Chinese government has a goal of sending a permanent manned space station into orbit by around 2022, state media say.. The rocket uses energy-saving technology, such as wireless communications instead of wired internet that by cutting weight has helped lower fuel costs by about 30 percent, Xinhua says. The craft can place a 100-kilogram load into orbit 800 kilometers from the earth, according to state media. It is the result of a government effort to foster China’s commercial space flight and encourage private participation in the sector, the state media said. The company expects 10 missions for carrier rockets in 2019, founder Shu Chang told the official China Daily last week. “I hope we can become one of the biggest small-satellite launchers in the world,” Shu said, adding that the company expects a large export market for its rockets in the future.

"Scientific studies show that climate change is occurring faster than species are changing. Some species have been able to meet the challenge with rapid evolutionary adaptation and other changes in behaviour or physiology. However, rapid adaptation to climate change often comes at a cost. Populations get smaller due to the deaths of individuals that cannot tolerate new, hotter temperatures. Even if species do evolve to survive with climate change, their smaller populations may still go extinct due to problems such as inbreeding, harmful new mutations or plain old bad luck, such as a disease epidemic. Evolutionary adaptation isn't species' only option. The only option is acclimation, sometimes called ""phenotypic plasticity"" or ""phenomenal acclimatization"" The authors found that the species that gained an average of 0.2 C (about 0.1 F) from climate change were more than 100 per cent more likely to survive than those that lost 0.3 C ( about 0.4 F) in the last century.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT
"Chinese researchers claim to have identified a unique group of cells that contributes to the ageing process. The cell subtype surrounds the motor neurons in the spinal cord and is believed to accelerate the ageing. It is a factor in the shuffling gait common among the elderly, according to an unedited paper published by the peer-reviewed journal Nature. The researchers tested the effects of vitamin C on 10 cynomolgus monkeys aged 17-18 years who were randomly divided into two groups. One group was given a daily dose of Vitamin C at 30mg/kg - dissolved in drinking water and given after breakfast - for 40 months. The other monkeys received the same quantity of drinking water, but without the supplement, to act as a control. The team analysed single cells to identify unique groups that developed around ageing motor neurons.

Greene: MASS is a textbook example of what a composer can do when he has the craft to conceal his craft. Bernstein's music is entertaining, illuminating and heartfelt, Greene writes, but with a clever twist. in ""A Simple Song,"" Bernstein spells ""G-d"" out in music with the middle left out in the traditional fashion, just as Bernstein leaves the third out of his chord. The word ""God"" has been placed on the ""forbidden"" tritone, rife with ambiguity and harmonic instability, ready to modulate into any key; it's a note of many colors, but, in the event, serves as a ""passing tone"" to the words ""simple song,"" which pass in four beats through iii, and a feint toward the dominant of A minor before settling on the relative major of A, C major, for the word 'lauda' And so it continues, sounding like a pop song and functioning on several levels all the way in the way Bernstein himself did at once, a musician's dream and a composer's dream.

Unless involuntary servitude has been somehow re-instituted for jazz musicians playing clubs, I'm not sure how any club owner is forcing any musician to play for free. A musician's desire to make a living as a performer does not automatically require the rest of society to like it and pay for it. How many club owners would ask Lady Gaga or Keith Jarrett to playFor free? None. Why? Because both artists can generate ticket sales and bar receipts that exceed their fees. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the club owner and the artist, which is how it must be. For most groups, especially jazz genre, it is impossible to do this on a regular basis. On top of that, keep in mind that approximately 60 percent of these businesses fail in the first three years. As if all of that boilerplate warfare weren't difficult enough, it gets worse by making several comparisons between musicians and strippers. And many jazz musicians are just confused -- they think that by virtue of opening a bar or restaurant, the owner automatically becomes a philanthropist with a registered 501(c)(3) If that's not the case, it's time for those unpaid wages to be paid!

"Irish startup Silicate is preparing to launch the initial trialof its advanced weathering technology to permanently eliminate carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The trial is set to occur near Chicago, US, with 500 tonnes of crushed waste concrete to be scattered over 50 hectares of agricultural land. Over one year, the ground concrete will disintegrate in the soil, activating an enhanced weathering process. During this process, the concrete will react with CO2 and turn it into carbonates, regarded as long-term storage solutions for CO2 emissions. Incorporating this substance into the soil helps to balance the pH levels, enabling better nutrient absorption for the plants. Consequently, this leads to healthier crops with increased yield and quality. Silicate then assesses the sequestered carbon emission, selling credits to major corporations to assist them in reducing their carbon footprint. By actively reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving soil health, Silicate’s solution is paving the way for a more eco-friendly and efficient future.",SAFE,ENVIRONMENT

Montana sold over 6,000 wolf-hunting licenses this season; each license -- $19 for state residents -- allows a person to kill up to five wolves. Wolf watching generates approximately $30 million annually to the towns around Yellowstone; the cost to reintroduce and recover wolves into the Northern Rockies was estimated to be more than $150 million.

"""Memphis"" is about as timely as one can get, given the intensification of attention to racial conflicts. The cast--the entire cast--had the opportunity to discuss their own experiences of the racial divide in our country. When we assume things--or people--to be one way or another, theater can be gruesome in its power and power in our personal lives, writes CNN's Nina dos Santos. ""Memphis,"" is a Tony award winning show about a white man from Memphis who radically transformed music history by starting to play ""black"" music, gospel and rhythm and blues, on mainstream stations. It's a richer experience since the actors are all involved in serving as well, so both they and audience members get to relate on different levels to one another, says Dos Santos, who saw the play in Fort Collins, Colorado, and was moved by the performance of the whole cast and crew. The show ends with dessert and bill paying come in intermission when the people you just saw as stars that could bring you to tears, come back to serve you again, says dos Santos, and it's a great way to say goodbye to a great play. Theater producer and director and owner of the Midtown Arts Center, Kurt Terrio, talked about the need for affordable theater, and about how having dining be part of the occasion can also remove some of the obstacles involved in traveling significant distances, he says.

"The mountain valleys of the North Indian state of Uttarakhand have been heavily developed with hydropower projects, tourism resorts and other infrastructure. When a cloudburst hit the state in June 2013, the choked rivers were unable to cope with the ravaging floods. Floodplains, marshes, dunes, reefs and mangrove forests -- often referred to as green infrastructure or bioshields -- are vital to making our societies more climate resilient. A new report published by International Rivers offers guidance on how to strengthen climate resilience in the water and energy sectors. The guide explains how rivers act as natural climate buffers, how large dams increase the vulnerability to climate change, and how climate resilience can be integrated into water resource management and infrastructure planning. The new report equips civil society groups to advocate for infrastructure investments that strengthen rather than weaken the climate resilience of ecosystems and human societies. Contact Dipti Vaghela at International Rivers if you would like to host a training or suggest a translation of the new guide, or if you want to offer a training on climate resilience to civil society organizations around the world. The report will be complemented by a video, and used for civil society training workshops on climate resilient in different parts of the world, including the U.S., China, South and Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America.

"Wolf Hall is based on the novels by Hilary Mantel. Mike Poulton has adapted them in broad brushstrokes and director Jeremy Herrin keeps all the gossip and scandal and backstabbing moving along nicely. But the great strength of the novels is their interior richness. Sadly, the play doesn't attempt this. A further problem is the Winter Garden Theatre. This is a gigantic venue perfect for spectacle (like ABBA's long-running Mamma Mia and Cats) You might assume Wolf Hall is a spectacle too (20+ actors! Medieval pageantry!) But it's not. The setting is spare and the strongest moments are very quiet ones. By and large, the closer you are to a drama the better you'll appreciate the actors and that is especially true in this giant space. I was lucky to have seats better than 75% of the audience but they were still too far away. Get within eight rows of the stage (and centered) and it won't improve the play as such but you'll certainly have more fun than the many people far behind you. Oh how this might have played better at say the tiny Circle In The Square. (Truly, finding the perfect venue for a show is a rarely acknowledged challenge. I assume economics played a factor in bringing this to the Winter garden since it's such an expensive endeavor, so who can blame them?)

"Hops, the flower of the hop plant, are the crucial fourth ingredient in the beer brewing process - alongside water, yeast and malt. In some key hop-growing areas, there was a drop of nearly 20% in output. Hotter, longer and drier summers are predicted to worsen the situation, and could lead to beer becoming more expensive. The authors warned growers to adapt their farming techniques. Beer is a staple of European culture - with 8.5 billion pints sold in the UK alone, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. The price of beer has already increased by 13% since the pandemic in 2020, due to an increase in energy costs driven by inflation, and the gas crisis following the invasion of Ukraine. But the study authors warn that further investment is needed, and say it will be necessary to expand the area used to grow aroma hops by 20%, to compensate for future decline.

As of October, wind and solar met between 25% and 41% of Texas' energy demand, depending on the month. But the boom has triggered a Texas-size showdown: Gov. Greg Abbott and a group of his fellow Republicans in the state legislature launched a campaign to prop up fossil fuels and penalize renewables, arguing it would make the grid more reliable. The high-stakes battle is a microcosm of how tricky America's green transition is shaping up to be, especially when politics are involved. The US is alreadylosing billions to deadly climate-fueled disastersthat scientists warn will get worse unless the world rapidly shifts away from fossil fuels. Yet there's still money and political points to be earned in oil and gas, indicating the fight is far from over.

"The Arabian sand boa is a non-venomous snake that has the cutest eyes on top of its head. They help it to see when it's hiding the rest of its body under sand, waiting for its next meal to come along. These ridiculous looking creatures eat whatever lizards, insects, and small mammals they can catch and squeeze to death. Female sand boas lay their eggs in small clutches. They have to help their young break out from the eggs when they are ready to hatch, after roughly nine weeks. The hatchlings lack an egg-tooth — a sharp projection on the snout, which the young of other snake species use to crack open their eggshells. They are common throughout their wide range and are not thought to be threatened by human activities, according to theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

She's the 18th mountain lion to be killed in a road collision in the region since 2002. Los Angeles is one of only two major cities in the world, along with Mumbai, that have big cats living within the city limits. The death is the latest sign of the difficult battle for survival the big cats face in the Santa Monica and Santa Ana mountains of the Los Angeles area. Wildlife and environmental activists have been advocating for the construction of a wildlife crossing over U.S. 101, which would allow for safe, freer access throughout the area by big cats. The Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing would create a 200-foot-long, 165-footwide overpass bridging U.s. 101 west of Liberty Canyon Road in the city of Agoura Hills, but the mission has lagged due to a lack of funds. The center last month joined with the Sierra Club and the Mountain Lion Foundation in a lawsuit against the Altair housing development approved by theCity of Temecula in Southern California. The suit argues that the 200-acre development and a multi-lane highway would impede the only passage left in the area for wildlife to move between coastal and inland mountains.

"Scientists created two human-pig embryos, then destroyed them after a few weeks of growth. The creations included human stem cells grown inside pig embryos. The scientists’ hope is that such recombinations could be used to grow replacement organs for humans. The possibility of growing human organs in pig embryos is still “far away,” researcher Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte says of the experiment in the journal Cell, in an article published Thursday. The U.S. suspended taxpayer funding for such animal-human combinations in 2015, and the Salk Institute is working on making human-friendly pancreases, hearts and livers in pigs. The vision raises huge ethical concerns, such as fears about an animal developing some human-like characteristics, a bioethics expert says. the work is “just a very early step toward the goal’s goal,’’ the researcher says. “Species evolve independently, and many factors dictating the developmental programs might have diverged, which makes it difficult to blend cells from one species to a developing embryo from another.’ “The larger the evolutionary distance, the more difficult for them to mix” Such combinations had been successfully created earlier with mice and rats, but larger animals like pigs would be needed to make human-sized organs, Dr. Jun Wu says. The animals would grow the organs in place of their own, and then would be euthanized before the organ is removed.",SENSITIVE,SCIENCE

Her mother, a colorful Irish Catholic matriarch with five children, frequently spouts bon mots grounded in paranoia. The book isn’t a lighthearted ode to her youth. She struggles with her father's ingrained misogyny, which he evinces with the confidence of a man who assumes that his audience agrees with his determination to have things all his own way. It is a memoir of growing up in a Catholic home, but also a love story of a young woman and her love for poetry and the city of Savannah, Savannah, Georgia, where she lived for some time in the early 1990s. It's also a look back on a childhood and young adulthood that took the place of a brewing storm in the young eye of a poet. The memoir, with its slightly off-color-seeming title, isn't a light-hearted Ode to Her Youth, but it does have its moments of lighthearted hilarity, as well as some dark moments, such as when Lockwood writes about being sexually assaulted by a boy she met on a dating website.

There is evidence that Planet 9 -- if it exists -- was kidnapped by the sun from its original host star. Earlier this year, researchers discovered the presence of a ninth planet by studying the orbits of icy objects beyond Neptune. They noticed anomalies in the objects' orbits and tracked them -- leading them to the gravitational pull of Planet 9.. The existence ofPlanet 9 is still unproved, and images have ""remained elusive"" But astronomers haven't been twiddling their thumbs. They have come up with a few hypotheses for what the planet may look like, but it's still not clear if this is just a theory or the real deal.. There's much more work to be done to figure out if this was just a Theory or the Real Deal. So, until we know for sure, we'll just keep thinking our solarsystem is a master thief, and that our sun may have stolen and captured Planet 9 from itsoriginal star..

"Jane Austen’s Pride & Prejudice spends little time describing what one of its principal characters, Mr. Darcy, actually looks like. This hasn’t stopped readers from surmising or projecting their own favored attributes onto a character who at the beginning of the story seems priggish and by the end is cast as kind-hearted and reserved. A thorough study by John Sutherland at University College London suggests otherwise. According to Sutherland, Darcy “would be elegant rather than brawny.” Not a soldier but a gentleman, he’d likely have “sloped shoulders,” and no facial hair, but mid-length, powdered hair on his head. “It was all about the legs,’ Sutherland wrote in his “dramatic re-appraisal” of the character. ‘The six-pack was unknown.’ But don”t be too hasty in writing him off; prejudice has the power of interfering with what could otherwise be a lasting kinship, Sutherland said. The professor combined his knowledge of values of the period to ensure a complete dismissal of preteen readers’ romantic hopes and dreams. He wrote that Darcy would be elegant, not a soldier, and not a gentleman.

By the middle of the 20th century, New York City had developed a distinct musical culture that reflected its polyglot character. The urban sprawl of metropolitan New York that made it a cultural driver of American society deeply influenced these artists and writers. Both men grew up on the metropolitan periphery: Joel in Hicksville, Long Island, and Springsteen in Freehold, N.J. But amid this growing affluence, both were also products of downward mobility, with Joel abandoned by his corporate executive father andSpringsteen’s grandfather, a lawyer, going to prison.

"25,000 bumblebees fell out of trees in an Oregon parking lot last month. Pesticides were immediately blamed, but a new study suggests the problem is more complex. The European Union recently passed a ban on neonicotinoids, which are linked to Colony Collapse Disorder. The U.S. has issued a temporary ban on the pesticides, but nothing as broad as the European law is being considered nationally. But outlawing a single class of pesticides won’t solve CCD, the study's lead author says, but it may help engender a more nuanced, effective solution. It has previously been believed that fungicides did not pose a risk to honey bees, but the Maryland and USDA scientists “found an increased probability” of bees being infected by the gut pathogen Nosema ceranae when exposed to high levels of fungicides. The fungal disease can “adversely affect honey bee colony health, and can result in complete colony collapse.” If the U.N. had banned neonicsotinoids along with the E.U., there might be 25,000 more bumble bees in Oregon. But the study hasn't identified any smoking gun either, but by offering proof that the issue is exceedingly complex, it may offer a way to reduce the number of bees that die from CCD in the first place. It’s a lot more complicated than just one product, which means of course the solution does not lie in just banning one class of product.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

"Scientists from Cornell University and Purdue University have identified a previously undiscovered mechanism triggered by calcium when it's added to soil. Their finding could lead to more strategic use of the mineral in agriculture. Soils with higher amounts of organic carbon are also able to deliver nutrients more efficiently to plants and promote plant growth, says lead researcher Itamar Shabtai, an assistant scientist with the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. ""If we can increase carbon in soil, we can perhaps make a dent in the increase in atmospheric CO2that we're seeing,"" says ShabTai. The researchers used the Canadian Light Source at the University of Saskatchewan to measure the amount of plant matter decomposed following the addition of calcium, while the Mid-IR beamline enabled them to identify and quantify the stabilized carbon in the soil. The findings can potentially benefit agricultural producers by giving them another tool to help maintain and improve the organic matter in their soils. ""Now that we have a better understanding of how calcium can impact how microbes improve soil carbon, we may be able to use soil amendments that contain calcium in a way that can benefitsoilorganic matter,"" says researcher Shab tai.",SAFE,ENVIRONMENT
"Wayne Brady is currently starring in the Chicago production of “Hamilton.” He says it’s more important than ever to support arts programming and initiatives. “I’m a trumpeter for the rights of all of us, especially being a black man in this country,” he said. Brady is no stranger to theater, having previously starred on Broadway in “Chicago” and “Kinky Boots.“Go out, support the arts, [support] the things that he [Trump] is killing,’’ he said of the president. ‘Hamilton’ resonates with what it means to be an American, Brady said, “like the line, ‘Immigrants, we get the job done.’ My folks are from the Virgin Islands, just like [Alexander] Hamilton. It”s inspirational to know that this little chain of islands can produce such greatness” Brady stars in ”Hamilton” at Chicago’S PrivateBank Theatre through April 9.

"Elon Musk's Neuralink received approval for human trials in May. Thousands of people are lining up for the opportunity, according to a report. The plot of the 2015 spy caper ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" features a similar neural implant as a key plot point. Musk is certainly not a believer in depopulation, and has frequently stated his belief that the planet needs more people on it, not less. And Musk won't look to ape Jackson's fictional Valentine by controlling people's minds with Neuralink's chips, becausebrain-computer interfacesdon't actually allow that. Instead, the brain controls the computer, and its possible applications for those with diseases like ALS could be significant. The film, which grossed over $400 million worldwide, came out two years before Neuralink was founded — though it seems unlikely Musk took any inspiration from a mid-budget action movie for his plans. The two also differ in cutting the world's population, with Musk not believing in it.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT
"Former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick will win and lose with the collusion grievance he’s filed against the NFL. The odds that he can actually prove that two or more owners got together exchanged texts, emails or left some paper trail in which they agreed that they’d do everything they could to make sure he never suited up again on their team or any other NFL team is slim to none. Still, it does not meet the sky-high bar to prove collusion but it reinforces what many in the sports world, many NFL players, and many in surveys and polls have said about him. The grievance is a public relations coup that no amount of money could buy. The complaint forced the NFL to scramble and issue pious statement after pious statement that it respects individual freedoms, including the right of players to protest. It challenges the owners to do more than pay lip service to backing social justice causes and the fight against racial injustice. It forced NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to swiftly squash media speculation that the NFL owners at their scheduled meeting would clamp down on the player's anthem protests by making it mandatory that they stand at rapt attention during the playing of the anthem. It stiffens the sternum of the NFL players association in their coming contract talks with NFL owners about pay, revenue sharing, health benefits, with special emphasis on the concussion issue. This is all great for the players and their association. It's great for Kap in that he could claim much of the credit for shaking up the league, much ofThe sports establishment, and even causing a significant number of NFL and sports fans to think hard about police abuse and racial injustice in society.",SENSITIVE,SPORTS

"World powers are running out of time to slash their use of high-polluting fossil fuels, draft says. U.N. promises to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) Temperatures have already risen by about 0.8 C (1.4F) since 1900. Draft estimates needed shift to low-carbon energies would cost between two and six percent of world output by 2050, it says. It says nations will have to impose drastic curbs on their still rising greenhouse gas emissions to keep a promise made by almost 200 countries in 2010 to keep global warming below 2 degrees C. The draft outlines ways to cut emissions and boost low- carbon energy, which includes renewables such as wind, hydro- and solar power, nuclear power and ""clean"" fossil fuels. ""The window is shutting very rapidly on the 2 degrees target,"" said Johan Rockstrom, head of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and an expert on risks to the planet from heatwaves, floods, droughts and rising seas. Another report by the IPCC last week in Japan showed warming already affects every continent and would damage food and water supplies and slow economic growth. The report raised the probability that human actions are the main cause of climate change since 1950 to at least 95 percent from at least 90 percent from 1950.
