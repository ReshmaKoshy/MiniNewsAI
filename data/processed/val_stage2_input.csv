"Israel’s oil production is essentially negligible in global energy markets. The attack against Israel and the outbreak of war in Gaza immediately drove up the price of oil. Conflict in oil-rich regions feeds the view for many investors and policymakers that the world must accelerate oil and gas investments. Building out renewable energy—as well as energy storage and low-carbon fuel technology—will inevitably leave the world less vulnerable to energy crises, says Andrew Keen.. The spike in prices that has resulted from the Israel-Gaza conflict won’t necessarily be sustained for years or even months, says Keen. But it’S important not to lose sight of the long-term trend: we may need oil now, but as the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast for the first time last month, fossil fuel demand will peak before 2030. It will not change the direction of the transition, but it will make it less likely that it will happen in the near future, Keen says. The price signal is often the single greatest determinant ofprofitability.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

"COP28 is the annual gathering of nearly 200 countries to discuss ways to prevent further manmade climate change. On the agenda: the phase-down — or even phase-out — of fossil fuels, a global goal to help the world adapt to extreme weather events, standards for trading carbon emissions and a new fund to pay for the damage wreaked by global warming. This year’s summit is expected to be the biggest yet, with more than 70,000 people expected. The rotating presidency is held by the United Arab Emirates, and COP28 will be held at the Expo City in Dubai. The talks are scheduled to last a fortnight, but they often spill over by an extra day or two as delegates argue over the final language of a communique that wraps up the meetings. The COP process made a breakthrough deal in Paris in 2015, when all countries agreed for the first time to ensure that temperature increases stay well below 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels.

"Scientists from Boston University and the University of Utah demonstrated how bloodstains can yield even more valuable details than what is typically gathered by detectives. By examining the protrusions that deviate from the boundaries of otherwise elliptical bloodstain, the researchers studied how these ""tails"" are formed. The tail length can reflect information about the size, impact speed, and impact angle of the blood drop that formed the stain. When measured for several blood stains in a stain pattern, the trajectories of the drops can be backtracked to their presumed origin.Knowing the origin of thebloodstains at a crime scene can help detectives determine whether a victim was standing or sitting, or help corroborate or question a witness's testimony. They believe that incorporating tail length into standard blood stain analyses will produce more robust evidentiary information. The study involved a series of high-speed experiments with human blood droplets with diameters of less than a millimeter impacting horizontal surfaces at various angles.

"All-ladies Mötley Crüe tribute band, Girls Girls Girls, broke up in 2014. Rachel Rampleman documents the group's performances and eccentric activities, like working the tailgate parties of the original band. She also documents the nuances of the individual women in the band, who have cover lives like superheroes ranging from guitar legend to broker to hair stylist. The band's bizarre-o world parallels a peculiar moment now inert in music history -- when men got dressed up like sexy ladies with big hair and tight pants and sang some of the most misogynistic songs ever written. As an outsider, it's a little bewildering to witness that love of the hair-metal movement, smelling oddly like Stockholm syndrome, but it is powerful beyond the underlying message of the lyrics of the songs. They endure and subject themselves to the same conversations over and over, just like the same songs over andover. What does it mean to love something that excludes you? Not unlike other marginalized populations who take on a powerful stance repossessing language, girls Girls Girls take on the hair metal movement's brags of all the women they went through like sweaty t-shirts tossed after a show by diving deeper into a deeper love of freedom, limitlessness and forever-youngness that came with machismo. These women are armed with an endless ability to deliver an endless number of drinks at every show. They deliver an ability to beat the original rock stars at their beat, every beat, and every time.",UNSAFE,ARTS & CULTURE
"Fish farming and shellfish production usually spew far less greenhouse gas emissions than production of beef and other animal protein. Many are like problems that face massive chicken, pig and cattle operations. The farms and the waste from them can degrade and pollute nearby ecosystems. Faced with stinging criticism and tighter regulations, fish farmers are trying new ways to boost production and minimize harm. In a warehouse near Miami, large indoor tanks are designed to mimic the natural environment of salmon by establishing the right temperature, the right salinity and the right lighting. The idea: Grow the salmon indoors to reduce exposure to parasites, warming waters and algae blooms that threaten the fish grown in farms in open waters near shore — and in turn reduce the fish’s impact on the shoreline.

"The 300-acre landslide in Oso, Washington, which killed at least 30 people, reveals a consequence of a relatively unregulated and unseen industry. Logging was not the sole cause of the disaster, but logging apparently played a major role. The media often do not investigate the reasons behind an event such as the landslide, attributing to ""Mother Nature"" or ""Acts of God"" disasters that were actually manmade. A system of belief that defies science and justifies irresponsible logging has become entrenched in our government agencies and universities, says John Rizzuto, author of the book ""Logging: The Truth About The Environmental Cost of Our Forests"" He says logging plans are not widely publicized, and most people remain unaware of the devastation wrought by typical modern logging practices, which rely on large machines and few workers to clear-cut the land. author: Logging proponents trivialize the damage from logging, arguing that although the land initially looks ravaged, the trees will grow back. The fact that we all use toilet paper is supposed to provide a carte blanche for loggers to do whatever they want to the forest, he says. Rizzutto: Loggers escape the burden of proving green-light claims without adequate environmental analysis or protection of vital resources, such as water, land and wildlife.

"Yahoo Sports viewed hundreds of pages of documents from the years-long probe. The documents show an underground recruiting operation that could create NCAA rules issues. Documents tie some of the biggest names and programs in the sport to activity that appears to violate amateurism rules. There’s potential impermissible benefits and preferential treatment for players and families of players at Duke, North Carolina, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan State, USC, Alabama and a host of other schools. The breadth of names, schools and current players could offer a vexing test for both university compliance offices and the NCAA's enforcement division.. The NCAA has been in constant contact with the feds but so far has had minimal direct involvement with the case, as they’ve been careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigation. No one is certain how the NCAA enforcement office would potentially handle the cases. “There's potential for chaos, as it depends on the number of cases and the amount of information released,” said Atlanta-based lawyer Stu Brown, a veteran of representing schools and coaches in NCAA compliance cases. The amount of detail for activities that have come under federal scrutiny is uncommon, but the records show an uncommon amount of activity for Brian Bowen, Brian Bowen's dad. For example, the expense reports have hundreds of lines for “Flight for Brian” Bowen, the dad of Brian Bowen; Bowen did not appear in the documents, but did not have to pay for the flight, according to the records.",SENSITIVE,SPORTS

"The comet, known as 12P/Pons-Brooks, is exploding relatively often and, confoundingly, far away from the sun. The comet is expected to reach peak brightness in mid-April 2024 as it continues on its 71.2-year journey around the Sun. At its closest, the comet will still be about one-and-half astronomical units away, or put another away: even further from Earth than the sun, a researcher says. ""It might be bright enough that you can see with your naked eye or with binoculars, but that's not because it's going to be super close,"" Teddy Kareta tells Insider.

The project is trying to narrow down uncertainties about how melting ice will swell the oceans. It is based on a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a leading climate research institute in Germany. The study is the first to examine evidence from climate history and combine it with computer simulations of contributing factors to long-term sea- level increases.

"Australian company Star Scientific has announced it will start building a factory in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2024. The investment is about $100 million, and the plant will eventually employ 200 employees to work at a 50-acre site that will contain up to 10 buildings. The process is called HERO which stands for Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser. Any desired temperature up to 700C degrees can be used to heat homes and offices. But it can also heat water into steam to drive turbines that produce electricity. It is similar to what happens in a coal-fired power plant, except there the coal is combusted and releases heavy carbon emissions. If the inflow is green hydrogen, there will be no carbon emissions in the entire process. But lots of energy will have been used to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen, which is an inefficient process. The full-life advantage of HERO is not clear, because blue hydrogen is produced along with a biproduct, CO2, that will have to be removed from the system.",SAFE,ENVIRONMENT

The figures get sliced by objects sometimes and are never facing the viewer. If the figure was facing you, then the painting would be a foil for the character of that figure rather than having the viewer be the most important figure in the painting.

"OnePlus 11 has three cameras on the back: a 50MP main camera, a 48MP wide-angle camera, and a 32MP Portrait Telephoto camera. The Google Pixel 8 only has two cameras: a 12MP camera and a 10.5MP selfie camera. Both phones use a spectral sensor to improve color accuracy. The Pixel 8’s realism and balance shine through in each photo. However, while I like the atmospheric shots the OnePlus 11 can take, the Pixel 8 wins out on the natural tone. Neither phone manages to extract a lot of detail through its natural-looking photos. It’re not hard to love the Pixel 11’S colorful and wide-angled photos, though they remain an eye-catcher, while thePixel 8 has more detail in the photo, especially when you crop it down.

"Major fossil fuel countries' plans to expand oil, gas and coal production would push the world far beyond the Paris deal's 1.5C global warming limit. Future of fossil fuels will be a key flashpoint when world leaders meet at the COP28 climate conference later this month. Most of the world's leading producers of fossil fuel have pledged to achieve ""net-zero"" emissions by midcentury. But the production plans of the top 20 producing countries are heading in the opposite direction, a UN report says. The report covers 20 countries that account for 82 percent of production and 73 percent of consumption of world's fossil fuel supply, including the United States, China, Russia, Australia and COP28 host United Arab Emirates. It found that planned increases in production in these countries would produce 460 percent more coal, 82 percent more gas, and 29 percent more oil than would be in line with the 1. 5C limit. a ""large discrepancy"" between governments' production plans and the need to rapidly move away from fossil fuels, says lead author on the report.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

"Semen Elistratov is the first athlete from Russia to win a medal at the Winter Olympics. He dedicated his accomplishment to compatriots he said had been banned from the Games. The International Olympic Committee is reportedly investigating his comments because of their apparently political nature. Elistatrov was suspended from skating in 2016 after the banned heart drug meldonium was found in his system. He was later granted amnesty by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which determined that low concentrations of the drug found in samples before March 1, 2016, were acceptable. He is one of the athletes competing at Pyeongchang under the banner of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team, which must follow strict IOC guidelines, including not wearing his country’s colors and refraining from “any public form of publicity, activity and communication associated with the national flag, anthem, emblem and symbol.” The IOC will report back at the end of the Games to the executive board to see if not just the letter but the spirit of the law has been breached, a spokesman told the BBC. The IOC banned Russia from competing in the Winter Games over its state-backed doping program over the past few years, but has since allowed some athletes to take part in the Games under the OAR banner in Pyeonchang. It is not clear if the IOC will ban ElistRatov from competing at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where he won a gold medal in the men's short track speed skating event.",SENSITIVE,SPORTS

"The Sierra Club filed a Freedom of Information Act request for environmental data held by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. Researchers fear that the incoming administration could wipe out important information on a broad range of environmental factors. Fears about data purges were sparked when Trump’s transition team reached out to the U.S. Energy Department in December demanding the names of employees and contract experts working on environmental and climate change issues. Under President George W. Bush, the EPA moved to shut down some of its research libraries, reducing access to important information. The administration was also accused by the Union of Concerned Scientists of suppressing or distorting research by government scientists or contractors at the Fish and Wildlife Service. Trump has called climate change a “hoax” by the Chinese to “make U.s. manufacturing non-competitive.” Incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus more recently said his boss believes it”s a ‘bunch of bunk.’ While the Sierra Club presses its request for data, other organized efforts are continuing to save what can be preserved from government databases and post the information on independent websites.

Tuesday marks the statistical ""peak day"" of the season, and researchers say significant amounts of dry air and wind shear have helped keep a lid on hurricane formation. The El Nino weather phenomenon, which is part of the mix of unstable ingredients that can affect hurricane formation, is also not a factor this year, making the lack of storm activity harder to explain. But whatever happens in the coming days, Dennis Feltgen cautioned it was still too early to write off 2013 as a when tropical weather was unpredictable. ""We are at the mid-point of the six-month hurricane season,"" he said, ""and it is a mistake to believe that the second half would resemble the first half"" The first hurricane in 2001, only formed on Sept. 9, and that season ended with 15 named storms, including four of which became major hurricanes, he said. An average season has six hurricanes, but this year has seven.",SAFE,ENVIRONMENT

"Researchers at Oxford University have used modern scientific technology to test a religious relic believed to belong to St. Nicholas. They used radiocarbon dating to investigate a pelvic bone fragment. The tests showed that the bone fragment dates to the fourth century, the period when some historians believe the saint died. Christian religious relics are physical objects that have an association with a saint or with Jesus Christ. In the Catholic tradition, relics are believed to be vehicles through which God brings healing and works miracles. The bone that the Oxford researchers analyzed came from Lyon in France, and is now owned by the Rev. Dennis O’Neill, a Catholic priest in the Chicago area who collects Christian relics. The researchers are now seeking to study the relics held in Bari, Italy, to see if the bone can be linked to that skeletal material and DNA. They’re hoping to use palaeogenomics and stable isotope analysis to figure out the deceased’s gender, age at time of death, and the geographic area in which the person lived. The bones are still buried in a crypt at the Basilica San Nicola in Bar i. Other parts are at the Chiesa di San Nicolo al Lido in Venice, Italy and at a church in the city of Bari called the San Nicola dei San Nicola. The relics are often kept in churches and “venerated” by the faithful, who come to touch, kiss, or pray next to these sacred objects.

Looters previously tunneled into the store and in their search of treasure pushed the victims’ bodies against a wall.

"Kevin Spacey has been announced as the host of the 71st Annual Tony Awards. The TV, film, and theater actor is a veteran of award shows. In 1991, he won a Tony for his performance in Neil Simon’s “Lost in Yonkers.” Spacey currently stars in the hit Netflix series “House of Cards’ as Frank Underwood, a scheming Southern Democrat with an unquenchable thirst for power. The Tony Awards can be viewed as a relatively niche award show, honoring performances and productions many outside of the New York metropolitan area haven’t had the opportunity to witness. Its viewership is typically smaller: In February, the unexpectedly eventful Oscars broadcast garnered 32.9 million viewers, while the 2016 Tony Awards tallied 8.7 million viewers. Even that modest award-show viewership may prove to be an outlier for the Broadway awards, which have garnered around 7 million viewers in previous years. The 2016 awards, hosted by late-night host James Corden, saw a 35 percent increase in viewership that many attributed to the national obsession with Lin-Manuel Miranda's “Hamilton” Now that the year of ‘Hamilton’ has passed, producers fear that the audiences will leave, according to ABC. Can CBS hope to retain those gains in audience by leading with A-list host Kevin Spacey? That remains to be seen, and we’re willing to wait for it. (Sorry, ""Hamilton"" fans.)",UNSAFE,ARTS & CULTURE

"The global aviation sector is responsible for a whopping six-percent of all industrial climate emissions. If the aviation sector were a country, they would be the seventh largest climate polluter in the world. The issue is so tricky that the UN agency ICAO has yet to develop an agreeable solution. Some airlines, namely major US carriers like United Airlines, have been throwing big lobbying dollars around that have effectively delayed any major action so far. It is a complicated piece of international policy that will likely start to gain attention as other sectors begin to deal with, and take responsibility for, their contributions to global climate change. The International Civil Aviation Organization is expected to make a recommendation on how to regulate emissions from the aviationsector at a major summit in Montreal, Canada in late September. Rumor is that I CAO will likely punt off a decision once again, to be made at some much later date.

"The March for Science has been critiqued as too elitist, too white, and unwilling to own up to the ways science has been misused as a tool of white supremacy throughout history. Some groups, including many of the large science associations involved in the march, have spoken of the effort as non-political. Scientists get involved to help set the record straight, offer their expertise, and fight for the truth, when necessary. It’s not scientists who make science political, it's politicians. The fossil fuel industry continues to spend millions every year on climate denial front groups, and millions more lobbying against renewable energy, environmental protections, or science based policy of any sort. All that spending has bought Big Oil plenty of friends on Capitol Hill. One of their favorite puppets has been Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, a climate denier who chairs none other than the House Committee for Science, Space and Technology. The Scopes Monkey Trial-like case has helped convince more scientists to speak out, especially about the lies they see being spread by the fossilfuel industry and their allies in Washington. More scientists are taking to the streets to push back on their attacks on their field and to become influential voices pushing back on attacks on science. The march is scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C. and at over 500 satellite marches all around the world on March 8 and 9, with the goal of raising awareness about climate change and the role of science in the 21st century.",SENSITIVE,SCIENCE

"IPCC provides a basis for science-based political decisions on climate change. But it does not make any direct recommendations for measures by states. The Paris Agreement has given nation states more leeway and left them more or less free to decide for themselves by how much they want to cut their emissions. If we want to avert the biggest dangers of climate change, we need to act very fast, says Bernd Siebenhüner, author of a new book on the IPCC and climate change in the 21st century. The IPCC report contains measures for climate protection, but only points out options. It does not give a breakdown of what would have to be done in Germany, for example, in order to meet the climate targets. Nor does the IPCC allocate an emissions budget to each individual country.

"Käthe Kollwitz knew profound personal suffering after her younger son Peter died in battle in Flanders in 1914. She recognized that she was expressing something greater than her own feelings and that her art could only function if it served an entire society. In the context of America’s recent Presidential election, it seems critical for artists to ask themselves about the role of empathy in their own work. Whether their work is political, personal or somewhere in-between, the element of empathy can allow an artist to “give voice to the sufferings of others,” as Käthe Kolwitz did so nobly in her works. The invention of empathy corresponds to many of the climactic shifts in the art, philosophy and psychology of fin-de-siècle Europe, and it changed the way artists thought about their work. The development of empathy as a social expectation and custom parallels the development of Expressionism: of inwardness as a gateway to emotional connection. That inwardness—so essential in the modern conception of a self-aware individual—is the hinge that connects to social awareness and the empathetic understanding of others. Empathy is, without doubt, a political force that plays a considerable role in attitudes towards social issues. In a recent article for Psychology Today, attorney and social advocate David Noise argues that empathy and “cousin” compassion are crucial elements in politics and policy, arguing that they “lead to an intelligent assessment of what is happening internally and around the world”",SENSITIVE,ARTS & CULTURE

Borean Orangutan are classified as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Habitat loss due to forest destruction is the primary cause of a significant population decline in recent decades. The DNA structure of orangUTans and humans differ by a remarkably small amount, so their willingness to learn and be challenged is not so surprising. The apes might just get in a boat and start rowing. Yes, they row boats. Although it might be imitation, it is still an incredible demonstration of teamwork. It is also a great example of how humans can help the orangutan in a variety of ways, from feeding to caring for their young to helping them with chores. It's a win-win situation for all of us, and it's a great lesson in how to live in the wild with the animals that we love and care for.

"New Broadway production of George Orwell’s dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, delivers such a slap. The pain inflicted by this 1984 is far more grippingly sensory than it is gratuitously gory. When dramatizing the actual narrative of the novel, 1984 is most effective. The performances are terrific, but there is something in the shaping of this performance that invites the audience in while, ultimately, leaving no way out. It's creepy and, at times, rather frustrating. But it works. It is no fun and neither was Orwell, from what I have read. But 1984 did provide me with one tangential wisp of reassurance. Even as 1984 delivered its fearful wake-up slap, I found myself realizing not every real-life authoritarian demagogue is as smart, effective and effective as George Orwell. This was, for me, a tiny, wishful saving grace. The show is open to interpretation and designed to leave the audience reeling and wondering. “Orwellian,” in other words, in other than “orwellian” The show opened last week at the Hudson Theatre, adapted and directed as it was in its original London incarnation by West End wunderkinds Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan.

The U.S. should not be an accessory to the production and sale of carbon-intensive oil, he says. oil is not inevitable, Zelizer writes, but it's a step in the right direction for U. S. energy security. The Obama Administration's rejection of Keystone could encourage more opposition to taking tar sands oil to market. The moral dimension is that helping Canada reduce its carbon budget is not in our national interest, he writes, and it's not in the world's interest to lead on climate change either. The President will have to figure out what to do with the diminishing carbon budget to meet his all-of-the-above energy policy and the prospect of leading the world in oil production in the next few years.

There seems to be a sour whiff of entitlement when Asha starts to moon about finding “something in a quaint, pastoral kingdom’’ The movie is about being true to yourself — in an unthreatening, non-competitive way — and the songs have been endemic in teen entertainment since High School Musical, and the lack of primacy in Frozen comes out in the wash, but it's hard to know who to expect from this one.

"Rev. Bernice King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter, was one of many who immediately pointed out historical parallels. She shared photos of civil rights leaders kneeling in protest next to a photo of NFL players Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid kneeling before a game. It was former Super Bowl quarterback Kaepernick who made the first quiet, courageous and moving decision of conscience last year to kneel during the national anthem. In a New York Times op-ed, Eric Reid said: “It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel.” All attempts with white supremacists to denigrate, divide and distract by anyone in high and low places must not and not prevail. We are better than this America. True patriots and all major faiths must never cease to struggle to close the gaps between the creed and deed and close the gap between creed and action. I urge all of us to engage in what Congressman Lewis calls “good and necessary trouble” Dr. King would cheer. It should go without saying that I love my country and I’m proud to be an American. But, to quote James Baldwin, ‘exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually’“I criticize America because I love her, and because I want to see her stand as the moral example of the world,” James Baldwin said.

"Researchers from the Institute of Earth Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have used the charge storage mechanism of tungsten-based nanomaterials for all-weather carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion. When exposed to simulated sunlight for 10 minutes, the catalyst demonstrated its ability to sustain the conversion of CO2to methane (CH4) even in the dark, marking the first instance of a single material achieving uninterrupted CO2conversion under all-condition. The data collected from the outdoor test facility showed that the CO2reduction process could continue at night and during rainy periods. This research approach has the potential to overcome critical technological bottlenecks in achieving continuous solar CO2utilization, according to the researchers.

"The New Conservatory Theatre Center recently presented the West Coast premiere of The Kid Thing. Written by Sarah Gubbins and powerfully directed by Becca Wolff, the play depicts the growing tensions between two middle class lesbian couples living in Chicago. The play examines how gay individuals and couples make life-altering decisions and how ideas about child-raising are often exacerbated by economic insecurities and internalized homophobia. The underlying conflict is how much each of these women wants to become a parent. By the end of Act I, two things have become painfully clear: The play is not for the faint-hearted or the easily offended. It is for those who are willing and able to take on the challenge of becoming a parent, but not those who fear the responsibility of it. It's a play for people of all ages and all walks of life, says Lois Tema, and it's not just for people who are gay or who are middle-class or who have children of their own. It was also a response to the deep questioning I observed from so many women on the brink of motherhood -- educated, middle- class, career-oriented, and partnered women wrestling with whether they had the resources to be parents.

But scientists say that like all reefs, they are fragile, and their location will only offer protection for so long in the face of a warming climate. Waters that get too warm cause corals to expel their colorful algae and turn white. They can survive if temperatures fall but they are left more vulnerable to disease and may eventually die.

We could convert a tiny fraction of the photons that fall on our planet in abundance into useable electricity that is intelligently re-distributed throughout our system.

The miscreants replaced the anti-totalitarian handbook's cover image and description text with that of an adult coloring book. Amazon removed the listing for the false coloring book on Wednesday, citing deviation from its guidelines for the fake. The publisher attributed the second, false entry — for a coloring book authored ostensibly by a “Timothy Strauss” — to Russians who wanted to undermine Snyder's work. Snyder is convinced that Russian hackers are interfering with his book in order to protect Trump, who has enjoyed a particularly bad couple of weeks thanks to the embarrassing implosion of his health care bill and the ongoing fiasco of the Congressional hearings on Russian election interference. “Russia has shown a tendency to jump in to help him at such times,” Snyder told The Guardian.

"Scientists are studying water vapor in the atmosphere of an exoplanet discovered in 2011. NASA reports that combined observations from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes reveal this planet has an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Orbiting a sun that’s twice as old as our own, HAT-P-26b is approximately the same size as one of our solar system's outer planets, Neptune, which also has a hydrogen-helium atmosphere. The planet is considered a “Warm Neptune” because it orbits its sun more closely than our own Neptune does, according to the University of Exeter in the U.K., where the research team is based. The research is important because it changes how scientists think about the birth and evolution of planetary systems, study leader Hannah Wakeford said in a NASA statement. “This kind of unexpected result is why I really love exploring the atmospheres of alien planets,” Wakeford says in a statement. ""This new discovery about its atmosphere feels like a big breakthrough in our pursuit to learn more about how solar systems are formed, and how it compares to our own,"" astrophysics professor David Sing says in the statement. The following video demonstrates how astronomers discover exoplanets using the transit method, and shows how to find them using the Hubble telescope and the Spitzer telescope. The video also shows how astronomers find them by looking at them from different vantage points, such as from the Earth, the moon and other planets in the solar system.",SAFE,SCIENCE

The school’s sexual abuse scandal began with accusations of serial assault of female gymnasts by former MSU doctor Larry Nassar. MSU President Lou Anna Simon and Athletic Director Mark Hollis bowed to pressure to resign amid criticisms that school officials mishandled sexual abuse complaints by Nassar years before he was formally charged in 2016. The NCAA, however, faced criticisms of its own when it was told more than three dozen sexual assault reports made against MSU athletes, but did nothing about it, according to a report on the group”s website. The group said it did nothing because it did not want to open lawsuits against the school because it could open the school to lawsuits by the NCAA and Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette.“It was absolutely heartbreaking to hear their stories and the pain and suffering they went through,” Izzo said of the women abused by the disgraced doctor. “I’m not going anywhere, in my mind.” “Every incident reported in that article was documented by either police or the Michigan State Title IX office” that deals with gender equality issues, he said. ‘We will cooperate with any investigation going forward,’ Izzo added. � “That’�s about all I have to say about it”",UNSAFE,SPORTS

He has said that his identity as an Indian-Canadian Sikh is central to who he is, and that he has a duty to honor those before him. The National Sikh Campaign hopes his appearance will help introduce the broader public to the Sikh community, and inform people that Sikhs are fighters and that we fight for equality.

The infinity symbol contains lines that come and go, it is assembled (impressively) as a series of separate small plates, roughly matching at each edge to continue the form. An association of these works with Peter Voulkos is inevitable, while her twenty four works against the wall seem formal heirs to Ken Price.

""I wanted to display and give away the painting to circumvent the traditional marketing system,"" says Mallinson. ""Raft"" is about the fine line between beauty and trash and about our tendency to purchase and discard. Mallinson offered her painting as something to be contemplated and cherished, or as something that should be returned to the artist for her best intentions to return to the public. In some cases it was clear that the painting might not be properly cared for or cared for. One of the panelists, Colin Gardner, observed that the project was a kind of ""Trojan Horse"" that delivered its message stealthily and delivered it to the right person at the right time. The painting was taken down and handed over to its new owner, who hadn't paid a cent for it. The panel made up of six carefully up of professionals -- a critic, a gallerist, a curator and two artists -- then deliberated after watching the taped conversations. After two hours and two hours of discussion and debate, the painting was returned to Mallinson for her back to the best of her intentions, but that would have been to the contrary to the original intentions of the artist.

"NoFit State Circus performs Bianco in a large tent outside of St. Ann's Warehouse. The Welsh company has a very well-trained group of performers and a fun aesthetic. One of the greatest strengths of this piece is the somewhat Brechtian way that the performers participate in not only the scene changes and the rigging set-ups, but also how they use other performers' bodies as counterweights. The audience interaction in Bianco consists of being herded around the space, but it was not an environment created to be engaged with in different ways. Most of the show is performed at night, so you don't have to be right in the front all the time. If you're going to watch a show live, please stay home or avoid going to live performances at least at least once a week. The only way to solve this problem is to eject audience members that do not allow them to reenter this and not let them reenter the show. Lights can distract performers just long enough for them to make mistakes that could injure them. Now, let me be clear: Having a cell phone out while performing complex moves is unbelievably dangerous and should be ejected from the performance. This was just theatre in the round with a few shifts of perspective. It's also possible the audience will be its own worst enemy here. Though the tent was a change of scenery, it wasn't an environment Created to be Engaged with in Different ways.

"European Food Safety Authority says wild bees and honeybees are put at risk by three pesticides from a group known as neonicotinoids. The European Union has since 2014 had a moratorium on use of the chemicals. EU nations will discuss a European Commission proposal to ban the chemicals next month. Crop chemical companies have argued that real-world evidence is not there to blame a global plunge in bee numbers on neonicsotinoid pesticides alone. bees are crucial for pollinating crops and pollinating the crops they are planted on, and their numbers have fallen in recent years due to a lack of food and other resources in the wild. The industry lobby said that while it allows that there may be a risk to bees, EFSA has overstated it. It argued that any risk can be managed and a ban would cause further harm by forcing farmers to extend agricultural lands. The findings will now be shared with European Commission risk managers and then with EU member States, who will decide on any potential changes to current restrictions, a spokeswoman for the EU executive said on Wednesday. The report is seen as crucial to whether the European moratorium on neonicotonoids use remains in place, the spokeswoman said. The updated risk assessment found variations due to factors such as species of bee, exposure and specific pesticide, “but overall the risk to the three types of bees we have assessed is confirmed,” said Jose Tarazona, head of EFSA’s pesticides unit. Some scenarios, such as when the pesticides are used on crops inside glass greenhouses, present a low risk, while others are high risk.",SENSITIVE,SCIENCE

Nola Darling is not so much a sex-positive, polyamorous, pansexual, black feminist 20-something artist living in Brooklyn as she is the idea of one. Each episode is, for better or worse, dominated by Spike Lee's very distinctly old-school point of view.

"Denis Johnson, the author of Jesus' Son and Tree of Smoke, died on Thursday. His death was confirmed by his longtime publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Johnson was best-known for his 1992 short story collection Jesus’ Son, which was adapted into a 1999 film starring Billy Crudup. He also wrote plays, poetry collections, screenplays, journalistic works, and numerous novels. His last novel, The Laughing Monsters, came out in 2014 and received comparatively unenthusiastic reviews. It was shortlisted for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize, but the fiction prize that year went, controversially, unawarded. His distinctive, arresting style and capacity for human insight can be found in stories like “Car Crash While Hitchhiking,’ “Happy Hour,” and “Emergency.” He was a powerful inspiration to many American writers, and his reputation amongst the literati has never faded. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, a son, and a daughter-in-law. He leaves behind a wife, a daughter, two sons, and two step-daughters, all of whom he left behind when he died at the age of 67. He was also the grandfather of a son and a step-daughter, both of whom are now in their late 20s and early 30s.

The long-simmering issue escalated in the fall of 2016 during the American League Championship Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Indians. The Change the Mascot campaign welcomed the Indians’ decision as a recognition “that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots” The group used the news to once again revive calls for the Washington football team to take similar action. “For too long, people of color have been stereotyped with these kinds of hurtful symbols, and no symbol is more hurtful than the football team in the nation’s capital using a dictionary-defined racial slur as its team name,” Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter said in an emailed statement.

The ban extends only to on-field displays, meaning the logo will still be a fixture on merchandise that’ll still be available throughout northern Ohio.

Today, says art therapist and research psychologist, Cathy Malchiodi, PhD, ""Art therapy is a pretty close match to many other non-therapy approaches, mainly in the realm of art teaching"" It's indispensable, and in a way, being a human being--no matter how wonderful your upbringing--can benefit from such therapy or even the practice of art in all its forms. It's a mental health profession in which clients, facilitated by the art therapist, use art media, the creative process, and the resulting artwork to explore their feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self awareness, manage behavior and addictions, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety, and increase self esteem.

It recorded a total of 195.4mm rainfall in October, exceeding the 193.8mm observed 153 years ago. Last month also had the warmest October day for 97 years, with a temperature of 21.7C. Its director Prof Michael Burton said the data sent a clear signal. ""There's no doubt in the pattern we're all seeing - these are all evidence of the world's changing climate,"" he said. It comes as communities in counties Down, Armagh and Antrim start to assess the damage after flooding this week.

"Antarctica is losing ice at an increasing pace, but the loss of sea ice may lead to more snowfall over the ice sheets. Penn State scientists analyzed the impacts of decreased sea ice in the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica. The researchers identified a feedback loop between sea ice and atmospheric water vapor. A more ice-free ocean surface intensifies evaporation, contributing to increased atmospheric water Vapor. This enhanced moisture causes a locally amplified greenhouse effect, resulting in heightened downward longwave radiation, which subsequently reduces sea ice the next month, the researchers said. The team's findings emphasize the need for refining current climate models to enhance their predictive accuracy, the scientists said.. Increasedsnowfallin Antarctica might slow the sea level rise, but it's essential to recognize that the ice sheet will continue to contribute to rising sea levels, they said. In 2022, we witnessed a new record low, and this year's levels are even lower, significantly below previous observations. These recent rapid changes in Antarctic sea ice highlight the urgency of understanding their causes and their potential impact on the Antarctic ice sheet.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

"2023 is now ""virtually certain"" that it will be the hottest year on record. No major climate science body expected this at the start of the year. El Niño may be releasing even more warmth than previous ones. Cutting some air pollutants may actually be having an unintended consequence. The sea-ice surrounding Antarctica is well below any previous recorded winter level. It is unclear whether this is a consequence of 2023's warmth or a result of climate change. However, a group of leading climate scientists recently warned that the climate may change more quickly than expected in the future. They suggest that the world hasn't yet tipped into a new phase of runaway climate change, but that it is likely to get worse in the coming decades.

"NASA has released a new set of maps showing the locations of subsurface ice on Mars. There is plenty of ice on the surface around the planet’s poles, but most mission concepts are more focused on the equatorial region. The new maps use high-resolution cameras on the orbiting Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission to look at regions where meteoroids had struck the planet and created impact craters that revealed the ice beneath. As well as being vital for future crewed missions, the presence of ice is relevant to the search for potential ancient life on the planet too. In the harsh environment of the Martian surface, ice can act as a radiation shield. Biosignatures of past life in many ways are more susceptible to ionizing radiation damage than actual living organisms. So ice could preserve signatures of ancient life. If you can melt ice you have water of course, which is believed to be essential to life. So, in the very big picture, our maps will be of interest to exobiology studies.”",SAFE,SCIENCE

"Owen Pallenberg, 14, wrote a poem about the wage gap in America. Women are paid on average 79 cents on the dollar for doing the same job as a man. Women with doctoral degrees are paid less than men with master’s degrees. The racial wage gap has not changed in thirty five years. Minimum wage in California is $10.50 for a man, More like $8.92 for a woman. The gap just gets worse for married women, women of color, and even mothers, Ridiculous, I know. Shouldn’t we all get paid the same as one another? Once men and women are equal, we will finally reach our ultimate goal. Just take a look at the US Women’S National Soccer Team, They earn about 25% of what the men make, which is really quite extreme, Even though the women generate more revenue and won the World Cup, They get paid much less to lace them up.” “I decided to write about the issue of the gender and race Wage Gap in our country because it is a very serious problem that has been recently overlooked due to the issues with President Trump, Syria, Health Care, and in honor of Mother’ s Day and the first annual 50/50 day.’ “79 Cents” by Owen Pallenberg: A woman makes on average79 cents to the man’�s buck, So the woman makes less because of her chromosomes’ luck.",SENSITIVE,ARTS & CULTURE
"Carolyn Kramer worked as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s. She said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry, but didn't protect her models. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don't necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the former agent said. It’s true that sexual assault allegations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by top magazines and brands in October 2017, Kramer said. But insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines big egos, drugs and young male egos. Weber has denied these claims, and while at least 18 current and former models recently accused photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment, he has denied any non-consensual behavior. The #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, and Kramer wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.

It’s believed to be the first time that Ursus americanus or any other bear species has been shown to have this ability. Migwan was born in the wild but was brought to the zoo as a cub in 2002 after being found with her face full of porcupine quills.

It's not clear if Migwan is ‘representing’ the photographs as real objects because we don’t know if she thinks the photograph IS the object, or understands the representational nature, in that photos are like objects but not exactly the same,’ she said.

At 23 minutes, it’s also the most extended piece. For Ganymede, Dexter got consumed by the idea that you could stand on the moon—the most habitable of the four—at night and see Jupiter and its aurora in its sky. For Europa, the ice moon with an underground ocean that might contain life, Dexter goes with a more mysterious sound. The composer says he was inspired by many composers, among the living by John Williams and Grant Kirkhope and the dead by Richard Strauss and Thomas Tallis.

This will help provide better observational constraints for models.

The 17-year-old Gerard, the youngest in the competition, landed a perfect backside triple cork 1440 on his final run. Despite frigid temperatures of -13 Celsius, the sun shone down on the fans gathered at the foot of the slope to cheer on the riders in PYEONGchang.

"American artist Jeff Koons (York, Pennsylvania, 1955) can be considered one of the most influential artists of his generation. He burst into the public arena back in the 1980s in New York, with his own interpretation of Duchamp's ready-mades in the style of Andy Warhol. He then evolved towards an art which blends the objective and more cerebral with the subjective and more sentimental. The work of Koons, full of sensuality and seduction, accurately depicts our post-modern capitalist era, which has made him successfully appealing to the masses. Koons tells us that we cannot comprehend his art if we do not previously let ourselves feel what his work awakens in us: the means to achieve, within the plane of ideas, the rational sense of his art. An optimistic message about overcoming and transcending that which is beyond the sensitive, inviting the spectator to converse with, and hence complete, his work, Elena Cué writes in her interview with Koons in Chelsea, New York. She asks Koons: Does your art express a nostalgia of childhood, as a kind of paradise without limits or repression? I think I ended up working with objects as metaphor for people. And it's not about finding relevance or perfection or imperfection in objects, but it's that you can accept yourself, and then go out and accept others. That's really the highest objective state.

At an average construction cost of Rs 8.3 crore per MW of coal-fired power estimated by a power ministry report in May, setting up the additional 30,000 MW capacity will entail investments of almost Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Given the 70:30 debt-equity ratio for power projects, it will entail a debt exposure in excess of Rs 1.7 lakh crore for lenders. Power ministerR K Singh told his counterparts from states that India must start work on 30,00 MW of new thermal generation capacity on top of 50,000MW already underway to avoid electricity shortage in future.

This year’s theme served two purposes: to highlight academic research specifically conducted by women paleontologists, and to inspire the public on the nature and need of museums. The audience is a mixture of young and old, fans and faculty. Talks are presented by scientists at all levels of their careers, from students to founders in the field. The keynote speech by Egyptian paleontologist Notham Sallam was delivered by graduate student Scott Mansraoui, a stalwart of women in paleontology. The conference was attended by more than 2,000 people, including students, faculty, and experts from around the world. It was the first time a meeting specifically showcasing the work of women has been held in the paleontological field. In the earliest days of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontological societies, there were few if any women in attendance. As the 20th Century paved the way for women to become more visible in the sciences, both women and men started to achieve a balanced ratio at these kinds of conferences.

Tragically he passed away at the age of thirty-eight while being treated for pneumonia, but it leads one to speculate on the endless possibilities his continued development would have brought to the music has he lived. This beautifully packaged two-disc set, Larry Young in Paris the ORTF Recordings, captures young in Paris sometime between 1964 and 1965 and features a series of ten songs played with different line ups and broadcast over French public radio. It marks the period just preceding Young's Blue Note Years and you can hear the sound that Young was developing, one that would later be honed with such precision on the groundbreaking album Unity.

Mortiz Wagner did most of the damage for Michigan with 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists while Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman also logged 12 points. Charles Matthews and Duncan Robinson were the only other Wolverines in double figures with 11 points each. “We had him in the scout team earlier in the year because he was still growing and was not a guy that was in our top nine,” Michigan coach Jim Beilein said of Poole after the game. � “You’ve just got to always be ready for the opportunity and for the moment,’’ said Poole of the shot that secured a date with the Sweet 16 next weekend. ‘It's a night for celebration.

The site’s front page announced the good “news” that the franchise had decided to rebrand as the Redhawks. It didn’t take long for the internet to realize the whole thing was a fake, and that the team and owner Dan Snyder had not done so. “I was happy to see that some people were immediately calling it out as fake,” said Sebastian Medina-Tayac, a Rising Hearts activist. The Washington franchise responded to the campaign on its Twitter account: ‘I just want to give my sincere thanks to the people running the social media and social media account for acknowledging our hard work over the last few months,’ he said. In the past, Snyder has pushed back against claims that the name is racist, arguing that it “represents honor, represents respect, represents pride, hopefully winning” He did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the fake campaign.. ‘We’re not going to boo the Redskins, we’ve going to cheer the Redhawk.’ “That is the cherry on the top, that they actually had to respond to that,“ Medina- tayac said, “that is the top.” “Our goal was to come up with a proactive message ― something that was positive”",SENSITIVE,SPORTS

At least 252 coaches and officials have been arrested, charged or disciplined byUSA Swimming for sexual assault or sexual misconduct against athletes under the age of 18. The organization has been “unwilling to take on its coach-centric power base and obsessed with protecting its image and brand,” the report says. USA Sw swimming did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment for this story. The investigation made five principal claims: Top USA Swimmers executives, officials and coaches knew of multiple sexual predators in coaching positions for years and did nothing to stop it. Some officials were not banned from the sport even after they had been convicted of felonies. Between 2006 and 2016, USA swimming spent $7,450,000 on legal fees.

There are approximately 145 million of them in use nationwide. This all adds up to 8.3 billion kWH khours of electricity consumed each year, the equivalent of the output of three large, coal-burning power plants (500 MW) The result, according to the NRDC, “is an estimated 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year.” These small, innocuous black boxes that never sleep consume enough electricity each year to power all 1.2 million homes in the Silicon Valley area, the hi-tech capital of the world.

"I have always hated involuntary psychiatric treatment. It is demeaning to human dignity, subject to abuse, and extremely unpleasant both to experience and to recommend. But there are rare times when pressuring someone into treatment becomes the lesser evil, preferable to the risks of suicide, violence, jail or homelessness. Involuntary commitment to inpatient psychiatric hospitals has become very uncommon in the US because almost all psychiatric hospitals have been closed. Forty-six states have adopted Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) statutes in an attempt both to improve the lives of the severely ill and also to reduce risk among those who are at highest risk if their severe mental illness goes untreated. Studies show that AOT improves symptoms and functioning and reduces hospitalizations, arrests, and violence. Most people in AOT convert successfully to voluntary treatment within a year. Many who were unhappy when originally ordered into outpatient care, later feel grateful once they have been helped by it. The Barnes/Badre argument about the lack of literature supporting long term antipsychotic treatment doesn't apply to most people who are in Aot on a short term basis. Because it is impossible to extend placebo controlled studies for indefinite periods, we will probably never have conclusive evidence on long term benefits vs. risks. For people with a history of persistent, dangerous, relapses, the real risks of antipsychotics are often outweighed by the substantial benefit. Protecting individual privacy is the most important thing we can do for people with severe, persistent, relapsed mental illness.",UNSAFE,SCIENCE

The Pulitzer is awarded to a playwright, but I'd argue there should be a citation in there somewhere for the director of the first production. Theater is a team sport; surely the actors, and the designers too, get credit for their efforts in the development of a new play.

So let's hear it for the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, whose imagination, comic timing, sense of pace and diction have given us many fine plays, including his latest, the Pulitzer Prize winning Between Riverside and Crazy. But let's also tip the hat to the director who helped him get there, Austin Pendleton, who was in the delivery room of the new play and helped him deliver it to the world.. The playwright knows when we get lucky as well. Some might argue that the Pulitzer is supposed to be an award purely for the script, unlike the Obies or the Tonys or the Outer Critics Circle Awards, where the prize for Best Play cannot help but be influenced by the production.

Floods have driven close to half a million people from their homes and crippled families' attempts to rebuild their drought-ravaged livelihoods. WFP activated a flood anticipatory action programme - its first in Africa - in coordination with the Government of Somalia. The floods have exacerbated Somalia's hunger crisis, at a time when significant funding shortfalls mean that WFP is only able to provide food assistance to less than half of the people most in need. With a quarter of Somalia's population - 4.3 million people - forecast to face crisis-level hunger or worse (IPC3+) by the end of the year, the support of the humanitarian community remains a lifeline.

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture is allowing organic livestock farmers in California to temporarily abandon the feeding standards that allow them to label their product as organic. Due to a lack of grass -- which livestock typically must graze on four months out of the year to be considered organic -- farmers whose grazing season includes February and March do not have to grass-feed their livestock during those months. The USDA issued the variance after receiving requests from the California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) and Marin Organic Certified Agriculture. According to the CCOF, organic producers are only allowed to substitute their livestock’s grass diet with organic feed, but other advocates for pesticide-free farming warn that this is still an unfortunate reinterpretation of what it means to farm organically. “We lost at least a month to a month-and-a-half of pasture,” Albert Straus of the Straus Family Creamery in Petaluma said, noting that the grass dried up back in December. ‘We’ll support this variance if that's the only alternative,’ Ronnie Cummuns, national director of the Organic Consumers Association, told The Huffington Post. Resorting to organic or non-organic feed robs consumers of the nutritional benefits of grass-fed meat and dairy, he said. ”Grass-fed dairy or beef has higher levels of Omega-3 and Omega-6, which is extremely important in human health,“ Cummins said.",SAFE,ENVIRONMENT

"""Shybot"" was part of a weirdly mesmerizing art project in early March. It was designed by the Italian artist Norma Jeane and engineers for the Desert X Biennial. The rover’s camera streamed its experiences back to The Lab art gallery in San Francisco. It traveled wherever it rolled, though assiduously avoided humans, and was forced to maneuver around obstacles too large for it to climb.. Drones tracked its progress from the air — which Shybot at times appeared not to appreciate. “The machine is let loose in the landscape, free of the human determinism that thus far framed its existence,” Jeane said. ‘And we, in turn, are free to imagine a world liberated from the indeterminacy of us.’ Got it? The artist called it a “fantasy of the desert sublime.” The project is one of several ongoing through the end of April in the Coachella Valley and the Sonoran Desert in southern California and its desert landscape. It’ll be on display at The Lab for the rest of the month, and the artist says it will be open to the public until April 30.

The Tiangong-1 station, which translates to “heavenly palace” in English, has been a topic of discussion among space-watchers for weeks after its fall towards Earth began to accelerate. Analysts said it was likely the 9.4-ton structure would tumble back home sometime between March 30 and April 2. The U.S. Strategic Command confirmed the re-entry in a statement on Sunday evening.

"The U.S. Department of Energy is distributing $36 million to 11 scientific projects that aim to help quantify exactly how much carbon potential ocean projects would be locking away. The basic idea behind ocean-based carbon removal has been around for decades: With a bit of human manipulation, the oceans could suck up billions of tons of carbon dioxide and take care of some of the world’sclimatewoes. Right now, such approaches are only able to remove a negligible amount of carbon from the atmosphere. They would need to be scaled up hundreds of thousands or even millions of times more to make a difference in the decades ahead. If they work, such engineering-heavy carbon removal methods—or simpler efforts like planting millions of trees—would need to come in alongside rapid worldwide emissions cuts in order for humanity to meet its climate goals. It's a subset of the nascent, venture capital fueled carbon removal industry, which also includes better known approaches likeClimeWorks’scarbon-sucking fans in Iceland.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

A family of bacteria called Halobacteriaceae use a red pigment to absorb sunlight and convert it into energy.“If land use and water consumption remain as it is now, then the lake would disappear pretty soon,” says a biologist at the University of Tehran. “There's no doubt about that,’ says Hossein Akhani, a scientist at the university. ‘If you want to see it, you have to go to it.’” The lake was once one of the world's largest brine shrimp habitats, but water loss and higher salinity are cutting into their growth and reproduction, says Akhani. The lake has lost about 70 percent of its surface area in the past 14 years, according to satellite observations. It is now a stained red pool, with sharp, white salt crystals left behind by evaporation now surround the shrinking pool, driving away tourists and migratory birds. It has happened before, but as drought and agricultural use persist in the region, red waters may become a more common sight, says a scientist in Tehran, Iran. The color-changing process may also be due to the production of protective carotenoids in the cells of the micro-algae.",SENSITIVE,SCIENCE
"Subglacial discharge from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) likely played a crucial role in the loss of ice sheet and the subsequent rise in sea level during the last deglaciation. The uranium isotopic composition of seawater is a potential tracer for subglacial. discharge and thus ice-sheet stability in the past. Researchers carried out a high-resolution deep-sea coral234U/238U records from the Drake Passage in the Southern Ocean. The findings provide an important reference for predicting possible future changes in the Antarctic ice sheet. The study was published inNature Communicationson Nov. 13, 2014, by Assoc.

"In some states, like Arizona and Idaho, the number of large fires burning each year has tripled or even quadrupled. Over the same span, average spring and summer temperatures across 11 Western states have increased by more than 1.5°F, contributing to the higher fire risks. In 2012, thin spring snowpack and above-average spring temperatures contributed to the biggest wildfire year in a decade in Arizona. Researchers predict that the area burned in the West will quadruple for every additional 1.8°F of temperature rise. In the past decade, more wildfires have burned in Utah in most of those years than any year in the 1970s. Every year since 2004 since 2004, every year in Arizona has seen more fires in Arizona than in any year since 1970. Spring snowpack has been decreasing dramatically in Nevada since the early 1980s. And in 2012, the lowest springSnowpack in more than 30 years, combined with above- average spring temperatures, helped fuel the biggest fire year in Colorado for more than a decade.

"Scientists have uncovered that violent star collisions, known as kilonovae, have the potential to pose a catastrophic threat to our planet due to the lethal release of radiation. The collision of neutron stars, each containing a mass equivalent to approximately one billion tons within a mere teaspoon, results in a particle explosion capable of annihilating our planet's ozone layer. If a neutron star merger were to occur within around 36 light-years of Earth, the resulting radiation could cause an extinction-level event.

"If we stay the course, the first humans will set foot on the Red Planet by the year 2033. The key to this architecture is to separate much of the supplies and equipment and send them in advance of the crew. The largest payload elements, such as the surface habitat and the ascent vehicle to return the crew to Mars orbit, weigh 30 to 40 metric tons. Improved entry, descent, and landing (EDL) approaches will safely and precisely land larger payloads on the surface of Mars. With a sustained program of activities over the next 10 to 15 years, we will eliminate the knowledge gaps that remain and we will build up an infrastructure that is capable of sustaining human missions, says Joe Cassady, Executive Director, Aerojet Rocketdyne. This piece is part of a special op-ed series, Explore Mars, curated with diverse contributors in public interest, in which we incorporate a combination of technology, public interest and political will to incorporate Mars into the overall structure of our future space program.

"Inflation is coming down, but it doesn't mean everything will get cheaper. President Joe Biden's administration recently released theFifth National Climate Assessment. The report analyzes the risks the climate crisis poses, and how those risks could threaten Americans and the economy. The impacts of the crisis will keep getting worse without significant action, and it'll increasingly strain Americans' budget as they struggle to afford basic household needs. It'll especially harm low-income and minority communities who live in areas with inefficient cooling systems and poor insulation. But the Federal Reserve has expressed confidence the country is moving in the direction it needs to reach the central bank's 2% inflation target. The Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation,increased 3.2% year-over-year in October, marking a decrease from the 3.7% reading a month prior. The Fed still does not forecast a recession right now, but the government's climate assessment casted a shadow on the economy's recovery.

"Negotiators for the EU's member states and lawmakers reach a deal on new rules to curb methane emissions. The provisional deal, which still needs to be formally approved to become law, was struck just two weeks before the start of COP28, the UN climate summit in Dubai. It requires the fossil fuel energy sector to have new measures to track and monitor methane gas emissions, and to prevent leaks. It bans routine venting and flaring and limits non-routing flared and venting to only when it is unavoidable. It also calls for methane monitoring measures on imports of oil, gas and coal into the European Union, to be introduced in three phases. The European Commission hailed Wednesday's agreement as ""crucial"" to the EU’s fight against climate change and says that, over a century, methane has an effect 28 times greater than that of carbon dioxide on global warming, and over a 20-year timescale it is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide, it says.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT

Long stretches of unmemorable choreography, at times deaf to the emotional swells of Prokofiev, were punctuated by brilliant outbursts from the exceptional supporting cast. Ballet to the People missed the class struggle of Lavrovsky's original 1940 Socialist Realist production, the bold crowd scenes of John Cranko's 1962 interpretation, and the oppressive grandeur of Kenneth MacMillan's in 1965. The crack-of-dawn bedroom pas de deux that opens Act III is a towering achievement of TomASSon's production, says Erik Tomass on the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra's performance. The Acrobats Norika Matsuyama, Francisco Mungamba and Wei Wang brought the house down with their elegant, fearless tumbling and spinning, says Tomassons on the Ballet orchestra's performance of the score, which is based on the work of Sergei Rachmaninoff and Dmitri Shostakovich. The ballet is set to a score by the composer, who also wrote the score for the film version of the play, ""Romeo and Juliet,"" which was released in 1973.

"Magnetic iron nanoparticles found in traffic fumes may be able to enter the brain, according to a new study. The tiny grains may contribute to brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, the researchers said. The nanoparticles are a form of iron oxide called magnetite. In the study, published Sep. 5 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found millions of magnetite particles in a gram of brain tissue. The particles are small enough that they can travel up the nose and reach the brain through the olfactory bulb, study author Barbara Maher said. But wearing a mask is unlikely to be useful to avoid getting a magnetic load from air pollution, she said, because the amount of pollution drops rapidly from the sky. The highest brain magnetite content was found in a 32-year-old Mexico City resident, the study said, and younger people who were exposed to high levels of air pollution in Mexico City also showed high concentrations of the particles in their brains. It's not fully known how iron is involved in the disease, but previous studies have found higher levels of iron in various brain areas of people with Alzheimer's. The researchers plan next to look directly at the toxicity of these particles by growing them in the lab by growing their own magnetite in a lab. This will be difficult to show, however, because people living in suburban areas will be more likely to be exposed to lower levels of particles, Maher said, even if those people are exposed to open fires and other pollution sources.",SENSITIVE,SCIENCE

Teams could be fined by the league if their players sit or kneel, as many have done in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in recent seasons. The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult with the union on the matter. The league also debated the issue in previous meetings since former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sparked national controversy in the 2016 season by taking a knee during the anthem. The movement, which grew to include other players and teams, continued in 2017, prompting repeated outrage from President Donald Trump. The union will review the new “policy’ and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement,” the union said. “As always, conversations at league meetings are candid, thoughtful and thorough,’’ an NFL spokesman told HuffPost in an email. ‘We will continue the conversation this morning,' the NFL spokesman said in an emailed response to a CNN request for comment on the new policy, which was not immediately available for comment.

"Antarctica is losing ice at an increasing pace, but the loss of sea ice may lead to more snowfall over the ice sheets. Penn State scientists analyzed the impacts of decreased sea ice in the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica. The researchers identified a feedback loop between sea ice and atmospheric water vapor. A more ice-free ocean surface intensifies evaporation, contributing to increased atmospheric water Vapor. This enhanced moisture causes a locally amplified greenhouse effect, resulting in heightened downward longwave radiation, which subsequently reduces sea ice the next month, the researchers said. The team's findings emphasize the need for refining current climate models to enhance their predictive accuracy, the scientists said.. Increasedsnowfallin Antarctica might slow the sea level rise, but it's essential to recognize that the ice sheet will continue to contribute to rising sea levels, they said.

"Shuffleton's Barbershop is arguably Norman Rockwell's masterpiece. It is chiaroscuro at its best – a noirscape of an after-hours moment in a small town barbershop. It was painted as the family crisis escalated and my grandmother Mary’s impending breakdown loomed like an invisible wraith inside the home. Mary had dedicated herself to my grandfather and his work for over 15 years before she began to collapse. She had never individuated – she went from being an overly protected, isolated child to the wife of an already famous and successful American illustrator, 15 years her senior. She tried everything to find a solution – went to doctor after doctor, becoming attached to each one – until she snapped one day at a coffee counter in Arlington, Vermont in the dead of winter in early 1951. She broke down into uncontrollable tears as she sat with the younger family doctor who had been trying to analyze and help her. Perhaps in that moment she realized he couldn’t save her, he didn't have the answers either, and once again, she was left with her overwhelming existential pain. This is the painting that had haunted me from afar. I felt apprehension, a well of emotion coming to the surface, as I sat in anticipation of seeing the painting in person for the first time.

"'Sculpture Victorious: Art in the Age of Invention 1837-1901' at Tate Britain aims at presenting Imperial Britain as elegant in spite of the obvious lack of restraint and excessive theatricality of their sculptures. The representation of elegance in England has not always been that easy. Henry VIII's conversion to protestantism and its consequent iconoclasm prevented indigenous painters and sculptors from enjoying the same level of patronage that they had in the continent. While the Spanish monarchs were used to purchase Titians, Rubens and Velazquez, Elizabeth I had to conform with a lesser kind of royal portraiture. The British could not restrain from showing off their bling bling in whichever opportunity they found.

"Extreme snowfall events may be a feature of some locations at higher latitudes and elevations in the decades to come. The warming effect at low-medium mountain elevations is predicted to instead enhanceextreme precipitation, with a 7% increase in rainfall per 1°C of warming globally. This contrast is likely to have consequences for the communities living in these environments, who rely on the regularity ofsnowfall for livelihoods, such as tourism and the skiing industry. The trend was most evident in the south of the French Alps, where the Mercantour massif is projected to experience a 39% reduction in mean annual snowfall at 1,800 melevation. The research is vitally important to translate across other cold mountainous regions to helplocal communities to plan future changes in environmental and socioeconomic management strategies that enable them to survive, say the researchers at the University of Grenoble Alpes, France.

"Youichiro Adachi is the 18th generation of his family to be a master cormorant fisherman. He is one of about 50 people in Japan carrying on the 1,300-year tradition of using trained birds to dive for fish. The method, known as ukai, was once common in Japan and a version of it has also been practised in China. But today it is largely supported by tourists, who watch the fishermen and their birds bringing in the catch. Now, environmental changes are making the fish ever more scarce and small, endangering the lifeline of the fisherman and their flocks. The fish like to eat algae that grow on large stones, but those rocks have become less common after repeated anti-flooding works carried out by river management authorities. “I go to the river every day so I can feel the changes,” Adachi said, drawing upon nearly four decades of working on the Nagara River in Oze, central Gifu prefecture.",SENSITIVE,ENVIRONMENT
"Australian activist Colin Russell was today released from a St. Petersburg detention center. Russell is the last of the Arctic 30 detainees to be freed on bail after the seizure of the Greenpeace International ship Arctic Sunrise more than two months ago. Russia has so far refused to participate in the proceedings at the Tribunal, invoking an exemption Russia added to its 1997 ratification of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Russia was not formally obliged to participate, but it is under an obligation to comply with any ruling the Tribunal makes. Such rulings are binding to any party to the UN convention on the law of the sea -- including Russia, says Greenpeace's Tim Lister, a lawyer for the ship's owners, the Dutch government. Greenpeace does not disagree and assumes that Russia will comply with the ITLOS ruling and stands ready to welcome home our friends and activists as soon as they are allowed to leave, Lister says. Russia is obligated to also comply with a ruling by releasing the ship and its crew, says Lister. The Netherlands had argued at the Hamburg-based Tribunal that Russia had no right to board and detain the ship, and all on board and that the detention of the crew is a violation of their right to liberty and security.

"Artist Iván Sikic buried a 24-karat gold nugget beneath 54 tons of dirt in an abandoned mansion in Peru's capital city, Lima. Sikic asked people to engage in the artwork by, well, digging. The installation was open to hunters for just three days, but when no one was able to uncover the nuggets, Sikic himself took on the role of miner to unearth it. The artwork thrusts the normally passive art-goer into a morally precarious position: he both relishes the dig and must question that enjoyment, he writes in a blog post about the piece. It's worth around $2,000, and Sikic says it's a reminder of gold's long and troubled history in Peru, where European settlers ravaged indigenous populations to extract it, and today’s mining practices are similarly destructive -- both to the Amazon Rainforest and to the lives of over 400,000 illegal miners. The art piece may no longer be open for those seeking riches, but it continues to address the unacknowledged ways income and lifestyle disparities can emerge from those riches. It was acquired through pure luck -- the gallery was located across the street from the derelict mansion, and the property developers were happy to give Sikic free artistic reign.

"Researchers have discovered a series of large undersea sediment deposits in a region near Italy that were likely formed by an ancient volcanic supereruption. The deposits, known as megabeds, were found in the western Marsili Basin, an area at the bottom of the Tyrrhenian Sea that surrounds the Marsili Seamount. The study suggests that these megabed originated not from nearby volcanoes, but from a volcanic province to the north. That province, researchers think, was an area once near the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI), the largest one of itsvolcanic eruptions since Campi Flegrei's formation nearly 50,000 years ago. If a volcano in this region were to erupt today, the movement of such vast magma deposits beneath the surface could trigger tsunamis threatening nearbycoastal citiesand cause a variety of other ecological disasters, the researchers say.

"A new study published inApplied and Environmental Microbiologyprovides the first characterization of the coral microbiome under hypoxia. The research is an initial step toward identifying potential beneficial bacteria for corals facing this environmental stressor. When there is not enough oxygen in the water, it throws the community of microorganisms on the coral out of balance, and some of the suspected harmful bacteria, such as Desulfovibrionaceae or Clostridia, become more active. This study is a first step toward understanding the response of coral microbiomes to deoxygenation which, along with warming andocean acidification, represent the ""triple threat"" of climate change to the ocean's ecosystem. The researchers plan to look more closely at the health of corals and relate that to the response to stressors when challenged by the stress of low oxygen. The bacteria that increased are those that can survive without oxygen and are ready to take advantage of a change in resources.

"David Perry: How do we know anything, ever, at all? Not unless we decide to trust our nervous systems and the perceptions they engender. We do not, truly, know anything because all we can do is perceive, he says. Perry: Science is not possible without faith in our perceptions, yet science itself tells us how limited those unaided perceptions are. Knowing within our sliver of reality, therefore, comes naturally; all the rest is rather harder. How we know is of practical importance to us every day, for science is being abused. The science of climate change is abused by deniers of the long established and increasingly obvious, he writes. The health benefits of eating vegetables and fruits and legumes are abused every time, until science is used to tell us everything we knew most reliably yesterday, Perry says. We did not suspect that apples fell down, not up from their trees before Newton’s calculations, he adds. We know that a passing fixation on lectins does nothing to alter the established benefits of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nor does a study of routine consumption of them alter the effects of environmental factors on health, nor do we ignore the influence of social factors on the environment. In this post-truth era, we seem to have forgotten, or allow ourselves to be mislead, where science is routinely mislead about what we know, or at least where we have forgotten to be at least at least to be honest about what science is.",SENSITIVE,SCIENCE

A pair of new papers has been delving into this rich evolutionary history, tracking where this group originated and how it spread around the world, as well as exploring the origin of their typical slow growth. Researchers found that the larger, modern group of crocodILians likely first appeared in Europe up to 145 million years ago. The ancestors of crocodiles and alligators then split from each other in North America, with the ability for crocodiles to tolerate saltwater meaning that they were then able to spread much further than alligators. It turns out that the life history of crocodile size turns out to be equally complex. The fossils of these creatures were in fact fast-growing, lethargic, active animals. It is now thought that many of these gigantic animals were growing far quicker than would be assumed for their size.",SAFE,SCIENCE

"About 100 genetically modified papaya trees were hacked down with machetes on Thursday night. The act is believed to be an act of eco-terrorism rather than random vandalism. The Big Island is currently considering the future of biotech on the island. One of the bills would require that the island's GMO papaya fields be cut down entirely, and farmers caught growing GMO papayas would face jail and fines. In 2011, about 10 acres of trees were cut down on the same papaya farm, and the year before, some 8,500 papaya Trees were similarly cut down. The police never solved those cases, and they have not been solved this time around, as well as a 2011 papaya incident in which about 8,000 trees were also cut down in the same area of the Big Island. In the 1950s, a ring spot virus wiped out Hawaii's papaya industry. The genetically modified version is credited with saving Hawaii's $11 million papayaindustry, which is now worth about $10 million a year to the state, according to the Hawaii Papaya Industry Association. It's not the first time activists have attacked genetically modified crops. Activists have taken weed-whackers to drought-resistant wheat crops in Australia and genetically modified eggplants in the Philippines. It means somebody has to have passionate reason, an industry official said, ""It's hard to imagine anybody putting that much effort into doing something like that,"" he told the AP. The incident -- the damages of which are valued at about three thousand dollars -- was relatively contained.",UNSAFE,ENVIRONMENT
"There has been much comment in the media about the issue of banks either denying accounts to people or closing the accounts of existing customers. What is slightly puzzling to me is that people are getting angry with the banks when the banks are responding rationally to the economic incentives set for them by their regulators. The U.S. Treasury Department has said that bank de-risking could hurt some communities and even “pose a national security risk” by driving transactions out of regulated institutions and into shadowy corners of global finance where they cannot be monitored. Instead, why not take low-risk people out of the loop completely? Go to a bank with your passport and get a Fed Pre Number. Then when you open a bank account, hire an accountant or wire money to an elephant in Thailand, without filing an SAR, you can give your money to the elephant. We could recognise this by allowing people with Fed Pre Numbers to send $100,000 to the Fed, and not need to do that.",SENSITIVE,SPORTS

"Spanish design students have created a ""water bottle"" that you can eat. ""Ooho"" is a gelatinous blob that is actually a membrane that encapsulates water. The gooey membrane is edible, hygienic and biodegradable. The design was a winner of the second annual Lexus Design Award and will also be featured during Milan Design Week.""Anyone can make them in their kitchen, modifying and innovating the recipe,"" said co-designer Rodrigo García González. ""It's not DIY but CIY — cook it yourself,"" said another co-Designer Guillaume Couche of the Ooho design. 'Ooho' is the first such container designed specifically for replacing water bottles, but it could be used for running sports events, for example, and could be infused with electrolytes to give competitors an athletic edge. The bag-like containers are also incredibly cheap — each one costs just 2 cents to make, and they could even be concocted at home, according to García García, who said the design is ""not DIY butCIY — cooking it yourself"" and can be made in the kitchen or on the go, he said. The Ooho globule is formed through a process called ""spherification,"" a methodology first pioneered in 1946 and still utilized by some chefs in modern cuisine. It is frozen into ice before being encapsulated to ease the process and prevent the water from mixing with the membrane ingredients.",SAFE,ENVIRONMENT
