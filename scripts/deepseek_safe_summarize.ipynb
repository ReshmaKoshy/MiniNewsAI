    "The book \"The Accidental Dictionary,\" written by expert Paul Anthony Jones, shows us that words in the English language don't always stay the same. The book is a special list of 100 words that reveals how their meanings have changed over time, proving that no word is truly \"set in stone.\" For example, the word \"clumsy\" once had a totally different meaning, which was \"numb with cold.\" Another interesting change is the word \"prestigious,\" which is a compliment today but used to mean \"deceitful,\" or tricky. Jones also found that words like \"man,\" \"girl,\" and a word called \"bimbo\" all used to mean just \"child.\" This little history book reminds us that as people change, our language changes right along with us.\n",

This is the first time that ancient DNA from a mummified non-human primate has been studied this much. The baboons were often shown in pictures with their arms up, showing respect to the sun, which was an important god in Egypt.\n",

      "\n",
      "The reason we capitalize \"I\" is because it's the first person singular nominative pronoun in English. In the past, it was easy for a little \"i\" to get lost on the page, so scribes started making it look like a lowercase \"j\" without the dot. Today, we still do this to help our words stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other languages have their own ways of showing respect for pronouns. For example, in German, all nouns are capitalized, while in Spanish, we say \"yo\" and in Russian, we write a small \"я\". So, even though we might be the only ones who capitalize \"I\", it's not because we're obsessed with ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the next time you see someone writing \"I\", remember that it's just a special way of showing that it's talking about the person who is reading or writing the sentence. And don't worry about capitalizing other words, like \"me\" or \"my\", because those are just regular words that don't need any special treatment.\n",
