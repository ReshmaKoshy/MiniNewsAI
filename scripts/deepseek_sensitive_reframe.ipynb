The first book will be Peter Ackroyd’s 1985 crime novel Hawskmoor. Bowie died at age 69 in January 2016 following an 18-month struggle with cancer. Jones told one tweeter who asked how to join that the person “just did,” indicating it was open to anyone on Twitter who wanted to read and then discuss the book. It's not clear whether Jones will stick to the list for future book club picks, however. The musician's official website revealed his “Top 100 Books” in 2013, with Hawksmoor appearing on the list, along with The Brief Wondrous Life Of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz and The Stranger by Albert Camus.\n",

      "This Dutch 23-Year-Old Epitomizes The Future Of American Filmmaking <TSEP> Joosje Duk's short film “Night” has screened at festivals in New York, Chicago, Connecticut, Florida, Boston, Nashville and the Netherlands. Duk is loosely based on a transaction Duk observed while waiting outside a nightclub in France. She is, in other words, a fabulist with a progressive perspective on cinema’s ability to deliver messages and unearth truths about the world. The ironic shift that occurs more than halfway through the short evokes a mastery commonly associated with more experienced filmmakers, Duk says. The short was the recipient of our annual Impact Award, given to a submission with social or political resonance. It was screened about three dozen shorts playing at Brooklyn”s Nitehawk Shorts Festival; we chose ‘Night’ as the recipient for our annual impact award.“Look here, here, look here,’” Duk said. “It was just the two black girls being rejected in an all-white world. When we were rehearsing it and rereading it and sharing it with people, it felt a little too preachy, and a little much like ‘Look, here’S what I’m doing.’ “ Duk also loved “Requiem for a Dream,” “Big Fish” and the Japanese drama “Late Spring Spring!” She also loved a Darren Aronofsky film, “Mothers of the Dream.”\n"

      "Eze Amos and Robert Cohen are both photographers who, in their own ways, have been telling the stories of their communities. Amos, born in Nigeria, lives in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he works a day job as a wedding photographer. Cohen, who grew up in New Orleans, now lives in St. Louis, and works as a photojournalist at the Post-Dispatch. Amos hopes to balance the negative perception of Charlottesville that has lingered since the August rally by showing the love and unity that most residents believe in. Cohen: It’s not the South, but it’'s a beautiful place but it still has that racism that has that I feel very welcome here, and I want to see more of that here in the future. The pair are part of a series of Q&As that profile two people with similar identities, but who live in very different places. As part of HuffPost's Listen To America tour, we’re exploring how people's lived experiences overlap and diverge depending on their zip codes.

      "Chelsea Clinton is releasing a children’s picture book titled She Persisted. The book is an homage to 13 American women who overcame personal and societal hurdles to achieve their dreams. The title recalls the now-iconic words used by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as he attempted to silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren in February. “I wrote this book for everyone who's ever wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down,” Clinton said in a statement issued by the publisher, Penguin Young Readers. The children's book will be illustrated by Alexandra Boiger and land in bookstores May 30. It will also feature a cameo by ‘another important female figure,’ according to EW.

      "Seattle Symphony Orchestra is the latest cultural institution to respond to President Donald Trump’s travel ban. On Feb. 8, the orchestra will host a concert featuring music from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Within hours of announcing the concert, all of the available tickets were claimed. The symphony is catering to the massive interest in the event by streaming it live on Facebook. The San Diego Youth Symphony is also demonstrating its devotion to diversity in music by featuring two young Syrian refugees — and impassioned musicians — in an upcoming performance. The Museum of Modern Art replaced artworks on its fifth floor gallery with works by artists from predominantly Muslim nations, highlighting artists like painter Ibrahim el-Salahi, painter Tala Madani and architect Zaha Hadid. Poet Kaveh Akbar rounded up poets with roots in the affected countries and shared them on Twitter. And the British publisher Comma pledged to forgo American titles in favor of Arabic writers, writers of Muslim heritage and refugees. Countless more have used both virtual and physical channels to express the profound impact the affected nations have had on culture. The Seattle Symphony will stand up to intolerance and bigotry through the universal power of music, and hopefully inspire other cultural institutions to follow suit. They hope that we can bring together our community to celebrate the freedom of expression and open exchange of ideas which the arts have always stood for, especially in times of division and conflict.” Join us for a free concert this Wednesday: https://t.co/0nOIpuYGxV. #MusicBeyondBorders pic.twitter.com/5fjrrj9w1d\n",

      "The perfect beach read is in the eye of the beholder. For some, getting lost in a faraway fantasy world appeals. For others, fantasy can be found closer to home, in whirlwind romances and compelling character studies. Whatever your preference, we recommend packing one of the following fun reads to dive into during your summer outings. The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty by Vendela Vida Vida’s narrator wanders the streets of Morocco in a series of increasingly absurd events. Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari doesn’t promise the nonstop laughs of most big releases by standup comics, but it does offer a comprehensive dive into the dynamics of dating today. The Star Side of Bird Hill by Naomi Jackson Jackson takes on heavy topics -- depression, grief, abandonment -- but with a backbone of hope that keeps the narrative aloft. The Enlightenment of Nina Gillies by Andrea Gillies dives deeper into her narrator's thoughts and motivations to reveal the stifling norms of society's strictures and stifling society's norms. The Sea of Happiness by Jennifer Tseng comes from Europa -- the publisher of Elena Ferrante's acclaimed series -- and employs the wonders of real-life Mayumi Mayumi. The Grandmothers by Doris Lessing is reminiscent of Lessing's The Grandis Lesser and Lessi's Lessis Lessis, and is a tale of the collapse of her marriage and her friendship with a younger patron of a bookshop in Greece.. Find Me by Laura van den Berg is a more personal, contemplative take on doomsday plotlines.\n",

      "January 9 of this year about 7500 gallons of crude 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) leaked out of a one-inch hole in a storage container owned by Freedom Industries. The container was about 50 feet away from the Elk River, the water supply for 300,000 West Virginians and a feeder tributary to water supplies down stream in Ohio and Indiana. Within days, two-week-old Freedom Industries filed chapter 11 bankruptcy. Remarkably -- according to Bloomberg News -- the company that's responsible for the largest public water supply poisoning in U.S. history was a days old merger that \"combined Etowah River Terminal, the facility where the leak occurred, Crete Technologies and Poca Blending, located in nearby Nitro [West Virginia].\" Unless someone's really into conspiracy theories, the timing of the merger is likely nothing more than shockingly good luck from a liability stand point. Not much is known about MCHM, but scientists at Universities across the American southeast have dedicated resources to learning more about its capacity for harm. Scientific American cautions that the really big questions remain unanswered; stating that the chemical's \"effects on cancer or inducing mutations in DNA is unknown\" All in all, the assault upon the water300,000West Virginians use to drink, prepare food, wash themselves and their belongings may go unpunished. West Virginia American Water (WVAW) is a for-profit company. Furnishing water to rate payers -- even though the guarantee of water safety still exists -- is very profitable. WVAW's parent company American Water reported net income from continuing operations of $374.3 million in 2012.\n",

      "Larry Kwong was the first person of color to play in the National Hockey League. The Chinese-Canadian athlete was born in 1923, the year Canada passed the Chinese Immigration Act. The legislation essentially banned all forms of Chinese immigration and wasn’t repealed for more than two decades. Kwong played just one major league game with the New York Rangers on March 13, 1948, and battled racism and discrimination on his way to the NHL. The hockey player was inducted into the B.C. Hockey Hall of Fame in 2010 and the Vancouver Sports Hall of fame in 2013. He is survived by a sister, daughter and two grandchildren, and died this past Thursday in Calgary, Canada, at the age of 94, according to his family’s grocery business. He was the son of Chinese immigrants and grew up in Vernon, British Columbia, during a time of fierce anti-Chinese sentiment across the country. He played hockey to entertain the troops while also building minesweepers in the shipyard during World War II. He left the NHL at the end of the season but continued playing several successful years in the Quebec Senior Hockey League and later overseas. After his sports career, he returned to his grocery business, retiring in 1996 and retiring from the NHL in 2000. He had a daughter, a son, and a daughter-in-law, all of whom are still living in the U.S., as well as a grandson, who is in his early 20s and a granddaughter.\n",

She said in a BBC Panorama documentary to air Monday that Mc enroe earned at least 10 times more than she did for BBC coverage of the Grand Slam tournament. “It makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this,” she said. BBC Sport told the Guardian that Mcenroe’s participation was of “a different scale, scope and time commitment.’ “He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences, and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission,’’ a BBC spokeswoman said. The BBC published a list of its highest-paid personalities, putting his pay between £150,000 and £199,999 ($210,560 to $280,740), HuffPost UK reported. The tennis championships last about two weeks, with about 10 appearances compared with 30 for Mc Enroe during Wimbledon, according to the Telegraph, which estimated the disparity at £15,000 to £200,000. The disparity didn’t add up when told that the BBC may use McEnroe”s greater hours as a defense, Navratillova said. ‘It was a shock because John Mc enroe makes at least 150,000 pounds. I get about 15,000 British pounds for. Wimbledon. And unless John Mcenroes is doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon,. he’m getting at least ten times as much money than I am for very comparable work,' she added.\n",

For the majority of the event, second baseman José Altuve stood stone-faced, hands at his side, most notably when Trump went down the line shaking hands. Altuve did shake the president's hand when being singled out, and he appeared gracious when the president complimented him, but there was a tinge of awkward hesitation in the air. The president tweeted about the meeting Monday evening: \"It was my great honor to welcome the 2017 World Series Champion Houston @Astros to the @WhiteHouse! #HoustonStrong pic.twitter.com/IO6B42jixA\" The president also tweeted: \"I'm okay with Altuve going for the sake of this moment: I'm okay. #Astros pic.Twitter.com /BQHgclZEYa\" The White House has a history of hosting pro athletes for photo ops, but it's unclear if this will be the first time that the Astros have been invited to the White House. The team won the World Series for the second year in a row. The Houston Astros are the first team to win the title since the New York Yankees in 2000. The White house has never hosted a World Series team since the Boston Red Sox in 2004.\n",

      "Nick Goepper won silver in the men's ski slopestyle at the Pyeongchang Olympics. The U.S. skier struggled to cope with the media attention after Sochi four years ago. The 19-year-old went into rehab and has not had a drink in two-and-a-half years. \"I just want to stay humble, stay focussed. I just love skiing and I love competing and I want to get back to it as soon as I can,” he said after his second Olympic win in Pyeonchang, his first since his bronze medal in Sochi in 2010, in the ski sloopestyle final in the 2010 Vancouver Games, in 2010. \"It is important to have a plan. Failure to plan is planning to fail,’ said the American after taking second place in Sunday’s ski sloopestyle final at the Games in PYEongchangs. The American says he had considered committing suicide in the build-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi as his drinking got out of hand after the Games. \"Alcohol was a symptom of this problem, for sure. That symptom got pretty bad at one point but I was able to go to a treatment center for a couple of months and figure myself out, getting the important help that I needed,\" he said in a statement after his win in Sunday's final, which was his second medal at the Winter Games in four years. He says he has not been drinking in two and a half years.\n",

      "Sweeney, 24, was speeding around a curve when she lost control, bounced off the walls and flew off her sled. She was conscious and was able to walk off the ice with some assistance. Sweeney was later seen being escorted to an ambulance and taken to a hospital for evaluation, according to online reports. According to an NBC reporter, citing a USA Luge source, the hospital evaluation is likely part of concussion protocol. This is Sweeney’s first Olympic appearance, but she is no stranger to the competition. She narrowly missed a spot at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Her older sister, Megan, ultimately nabbed that spot, NBC reported. She refused a stretcher and walked away from the crash on her own, the report said. The U.S. luger is competing in the women's singles competition at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, which runs from February 14 to February 21. The event is part of the Winter Games in North Korea, which is the first Winter Olympics for the country since 1988. It's the first time North Korea has hosted the Winter Olympics since 1988, when it was the site of the games in Calgary, Canada. It is the second time the country has had a Winter Olympics team in the singles competition, following the 1988 Games in Calgary and the 1992 Games in Albertus Magnus, Switzerland, which was the first. The women's event is scheduled to run from February 16 to February 19. The men's event will run on February 19 and 20.\n",

      "Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas, wide receiver Kenny Stills and tight end Julius Thomas each took a knee during the anthem in Sunday’s game against the Oakland Raiders. Dolphins’ head coach Adam Gase instituted a team policy in October which told players to either stand for the anthem or stay in the tunnel leading to the field. After a conversation between the players and Gase, the coach chose to respect their position and eased up on his previous policy. The compromise comes just a day after the team announced that it was launching an annual fund for social justice programs. Colin Kaepernick, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback, has been credited with starting the protests last year when he took a kneeling during the national anthem at a game in an effort to raise awareness for racial injustice. President Donald Trump furthered the controversy in September when he implicitly called Kaepernick a “son of a bitch” and called on NFL fans to boycott games when kneeling occurred. “Whenever you’re dealing with the flag, you're dealing with something different. (Trump) has changed that whole paradigm of what protest is,” team owner Stephen Ross said at his weekly tailgate last month. \"I think it's incumbent upon the players today, because of how the public is looking at it, is to stand and salute the flag,\" Ross said in an interview with the Palm Beach Post in October. The Dolphins have created a yearly fund for PAL of @NorthMiamiPD, @5000RoleModels, and @RISEtoWIN.\n",

      "Maria Sharapova beat Simona Halep 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in the first round of the U.S. Open. The five-time Grand Slam singles champion served a 15-month doping ban. “Behind all these Swarovski crystals and sparkly little black dresses, this girl has a lot of grit and is not going anywhere,” she said of Halep after the match. She received a wild card invitation to the US Open after overcoming injuries that stalled her comeback. The Russian beat Halep in three sets to advance to the second round for the first time in her career. She will face either Caroline Wozniacki or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the next round. The winner of that match will face Angelique Kerber in the quarterfinals on Tuesday. The other was Victoria Azarenka, who beat Petra Kvitova in a three-set thriller in the fourth round on Sunday. She was the first Russian woman to reach the last 16 of a Grand Slam tournament since Martina Navratilova in 1996. The last Russian to do so was Maria Wawrinka in 1996, when she won the women's singles title at the Australian Open. It was her first Grand Slam title since she won it in 1998.

McGregor, 21-3 in mixed martial arts but making his pro boxing debut, was the underdog. Former WBA lightweight champ Ray “Boom-Boom” Mancini said Mayweather’s skills have deteriorated as he has gotten older. “He is done and he knows it. But we’ve seen the last of him,” boxing promoter Lou DiBella told HuffPost from the arena.“The fact that McGregor was so awkward in the ring probably made it even harder for Mayweather at first. But he figured it out. It was actually entertaining to watch,’ DiB Bella said of the bout with the Irishman. ‘The ref should have let me keep going. I was just a little fatigued,' McGregor said after the fight. \"I thought it was close, and I thought the stoppage was a little early,\" McGregor said. \"He's a lot better than I thought he was. But I was the better man tonight. ... Our game plan was to take our time. ... Then take him out at the end,\" Mayweather said of his opponent. \"We’re in the entertainment business, and this was a very entertaining fight.” \"He was a step behind. He was coming in from another discipline, and it showed.’\n",

      "The International Olympic Committee awarded the 2024 games to Paris, not Los Angeles. L.A. had hosted two successful Olympic Games: 1932 and 1984. Paris, meanwhile, has not hosted an Olympic Games since 1924. Trump’s verbal attacks on Mexico and his decision to build the wall and put travel bans on several countries, is unpopular worldwide, and even in America as well. His “America First,” slogan might play well in Ocala, Florida, might not in the Olympic Committee, which likely cringed at the prospect of a Trump in his last year in office (if reelected) giving a long speech similar to the Boy Scout lecture in July. It seems as though the IOC really wanted the Olympics to return to Los Angeles as soon as possible, on the anniversary of the highly successful 2024 games. But they couldn’t swallow the specter of Trump calling for the crowd to boo domestic rivals, bragging about this big electoral win, and making inappropriate references or nationalistic appeals. The French President is determined to bring the games to a country that embodies ‘openness, tolerance and respect for the environment,’” an open reference to his country's support for the Paris Agreement, something President Trump openly rejected, claiming he was dedicated to protecting Pittsburgh, and not Paris. “Olympic values are our values.” If he”s reelected, he’ll play the host to the 2024 Olympic Games. The mayor vowed to protect Los Angeles taxpayers’ money and to use the event as a way to create long-lasting access to sports for children.\n",

Rampant deforestation, driven by agricultural expansion and logging activity, reduces the Amazon rainforest's ability to regulate the climate and retain moisture. The impact of hydroelectric dams also play a role in contributing to the drought scenario, especially on the Madeira River. The combination of these factors results in a significant impact on the balance of the drought in the region, making hydroelectric dams one of the causes of drought in Amazon, with worrying environmental and social consequences.

In 2023 alone, there have been 38 days where the global average temperature has been more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. By the end of the 21st century, as many as 3-6 billion people may find themselves outside the Earth's livable regions, the report states. The authors urge transitioning to a global economy that prioritizes human well-being and reduces overconsumption and excessive emissions by the rich. They stress that all climate-related actions must be grounded in equity and social justice, noting that extreme weather impacts are being disproportionately felt by the poorest people, who contributed the least to climate change. The report follows by four years the \"World Scientists' Warning of a Climate Emergency\" published by Ripple and collaborators in BioScience and co-signed by more than 15,000 scientists in 161 countries. The highest average Earth surface temperature ever recorded came this past July, and there's reason to believe it was the highest surface temperature the planet has seen in the last 100,000 years.\n",

The deal to create the fund was seen as a breakthrough for developing country negotiators at the United Nations climate talks in Egypt last year. However, in the past 11 months, governments have struggled to reach consensus on the details of the fund, such as who will pay and where the fund will be located. A special UN committee tasked with implementing the fund met for a fifth time in Abu Dhabi this week to finalize recommendations that will be put to governments when they meet for the annual climate summit COP28 in Dubai in less than four weeks' time. The goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024. To get all countries on board, it was agreed that the World Bank would serve as interim trustee and host of the Fund for a four-year period.\n",

The Stamp Stampede was set up to let attendees stamp their own currency with messages like \"NOT 2 B USED FOR BRIBING POLITICIANS\" and \"STAMP MONEY OUT OF POLITICS\" This form of spreading an idea through public messages is similar to street art's success in reaching a broader audience.

The frieze will be activated with live shadow play, a procession of performers, voice, and music during its opening. Kentridge is known for his charcoal drawings, animated films dealing with social injustice in South Africa, and his interest in music and theater. He has created stage designs for operas by Monteverdi, Mozart, Shostakovich, and Mozart's Mozart in Auf Wiedersehen. For the musical complement to his own work, Kentridge has collaborated with Cape Town-based composer Philip Miller, who scored the original music for apartheid-era South African play, The Taming of the Shrew. For more information, visit www.triumphsandlaments.com. The site-specific performance will take place on April 21 and 22, at 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Ponte Margherita, Rome.
